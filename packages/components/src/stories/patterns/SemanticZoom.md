# Semantic zoom

Controlling the [density](/patterns/qualities/density#information-density) of a GUI through dynamic, user-driven transformations of information representation: showing different types and amounts of information at different scales.

Within the [view](/patterns/foundations/view-system) system, semantic zoom enables fluid transitions across framing dimensions while preserving spatial context.

## Transformation patterns

- Scale-dependent swap: at defined thresholds, switches to a different, more legible representation (eg, text turns into an abstract; node clouds condense to clusters).
- In-place unfolding
- Context-preserving motion: avoid teleporting popups or modal detours.
- Scope transitions: navigate between collection view and individual item detail while maintaining spatial context.

## User-driven detail control
Users determine their own information needs moment by moment, rather than being constrained by pre-packaged interface decisions. This shifts agency from designer to user.

## Context preservation
As detail levels change, surrounding context remains visible and comprehensible.

## Multi-level abstraction
Information exists simultaneously at multiple levels of detail—from high-level summaries to granular specifics—with smooth transitions between them.

### Focus plus context
Borrowing from fish-eye distortion techniques, semantic zoom allows simultaneous focus on details while maintaining awareness of the broader information landscape.
