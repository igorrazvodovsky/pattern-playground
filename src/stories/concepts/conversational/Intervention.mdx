# Intervention

## Purpose

Pause or divert normal execution when an actor identifies an issue, uncertainty, or authority gap, and coordinate the follow-up needed to resolve it.

## Operational principle

When an actor raises an intervention on an entity, record the reason and type, and create a follow-up path until it is resolved or closed.

## State

- status: open, resolved
- target: task
- raised by
- type: exception, escalation, clarification, etc.
- reason
- created at
- followup

## Actions

- raise
- start followup
- resolve

## Synchronisations

- Conversation
- Task
- Planning
- Delegation
- Commitment
- Domain
- Trigger
- Interpretation

{/*
### Intervention-Conversation
- Conversation → Intervention.raise: Any actor in a conversation can raise interventions for issues or clarifications
- Intervention.resolve → Conversation.logEvent: Intervention resolutions are communicated back to the conversation
- Intervention → Conversation.start: Escalation triggers higher-authority conversations for resolution

### Intervention-Task
- Task.block → Intervention.raise: Blocked tasks trigger interventions for resolution
- Task overdue → Intervention: Tasks past deadline without completion trigger interventions
- Task.request → Intervention.raise: Fulfiler requests for clarification raise interventions
- Intervention.resolve → Task.resume: Intervention resolutions enable blocked tasks to resume
- Intervention → Task.create: Clarification interventions may create decision tasks for resolution

### Intervention-Planning
- Planning.analyse → Intervention.raise: Resource or capability gaps trigger interventions during analysis
- Intervention.resolve → Planning.revise: Intervention resolutions inform plan modifications
- Planning overdue → Intervention: Stalled planning processes trigger interventions for unblocking

### Intervention-Delegation
- Delegation.escalate → Intervention.raise: Authority gaps trigger interventions for resolution
- Intervention.resolve → Delegation.adjust: Intervention resolutions may modify delegation parameters
- Delegation overdue → Intervention: Stuck delegations trigger interventions for unblocking

### Intervention-Commitment
- Commitment overdue → Intervention: Commitments past deadline trigger interventions for escalation or clarification
- Intervention.resolve → Commitment.reschedule: Intervention resolutions may result in commitment rescheduling
- Intervention → Commitment.clear: Some interventions may void commitments when tasks become impossible

### Intervention-Domain
- Domain mismatch → Intervention.raise: Requests not fitting existing domains trigger interventions
- Intervention.resolve → Domain.defineCategory: Interventions may result in new domain categories
- Domain boundaries → Intervention: Work crossing domain boundaries may trigger coordination interventions

### Intervention-Trigger
- Intervention patterns → Trigger: Recurring intervention types can trigger automated prevention measures
- Intervention.resolve → Trigger: Intervention resolutions can trigger follow-up actions or monitoring
- System errors → Trigger → Intervention.raise: Automated error detection triggers intervention creation

### Intervention-Interpretation
- Interpretation.reject → Intervention.raise: Rejected interpretations trigger interventions for clarification
- Intervention → Interpretation.refine: Interventions may lead to interpretation refinement
- Interpretation gaps → Intervention: Missing or unclear interpretations trigger intervention requests
