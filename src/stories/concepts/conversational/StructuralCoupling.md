# Structural coupling

## What Winograd & Flores mean
- Structural coupling is the ongoing, mutual adaptation between an organism (or organisation) and its environment.
- Through recurrent interactions, both sides reshape each other.
- Structural coupling explains why patterns of conversation persist: they’re not arbitrary; they are stabilised by the organisation’s history of mutual interactions with its world.

## In design terms

- What it looks like: stable patterns of commitments, categories, tools, and conversations.

## (Maybe) Keep “structural coupling” as explanatory framing, not a first-class concept but to annotate other concepts:
- Conversation → couples shop to its customers.
- Domain → couples shop to systemic categories (sizes, SLAs).
- Commitment → couples shop to time expectations.
- Intervention → couples shop to its environment’s unpredictable perturbations.
