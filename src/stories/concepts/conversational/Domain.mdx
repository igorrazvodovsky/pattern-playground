# Domain

## Purpose
Define a shared context or area of responsibility for a set of tasks or conversations,

## Operational principle
When a request is assigned to a domain, then its conditions of satisfaction and commitments can be drawn from the domain’s distinctions instead of being negotiated from scratch.

## State

- categories: the named “bins” (e.g., t-shirt sizes: S, M, L).
- properties: the measurable or descriptive distinctions attached to each category (e.g. chest 92–96 cm)
- criteria: the conditions of satisfaction that follow from being in that category
- assigned: which tasks are currently interpreted as falling into which category

## Actions

- defineCategory
- addProperty
- setCriteria
- assign

## Synchronisations

- Domain → Satisfaction condition: When a request is assigned to a domain, its condition of satisfaction can be derived automatically.
- Domain → Conversation: When you assign a request to a domain, broadcast it into the conversation so everyone knows what framework applies.
- Intervention → Domain: If a request doesn’t fit any existing domain (e.g., customer wants an exotic customisation), raise an intervention.
- Commitment → Domain: Commitments may draw deadlines or acceptance criteria from the domain.

## Limitations and risks
- Incomplete by design: no domain anticipates every breakdown.
- Interpretive: what counts as belonging to a domain is negotiated by actors.
