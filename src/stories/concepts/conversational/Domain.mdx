# Domain

## Purpose
Define a shared context or area of responsibility for a set of tasks or conversations,

## Operational principle
When a request is assigned to a domain, then its conditions of satisfaction and commitments can be drawn from the domain’s distinctions instead of being negotiated from scratch.

## State

- categories: the named “bins” (e.g., t-shirt sizes: S, M, L).
- properties: the measurable or descriptive distinctions attached to each category (e.g. chest 92–96 cm)
- criteria: the conditions of satisfaction that follow from being in that category
- assigned: which tasks are currently interpreted as falling into which category

## Actions

- defineCategory
- addProperty
- setCriteria
- assign

## Synchronisations

- Conversation
- Task
- Planning
- Delegation
- Commitment
- Intervention
- Trigger
- Interpretation

{/*
### Domain-Conversation
- Conversation.start → Domain.assign: New conversations are assigned to appropriate domains for context and criteria
- Domain.assign → Conversation.logEvent: Domain assignment is broadcast into the conversation for stakeholder awareness
- Conversation satisfaction → Domain criteria: Conversation completion validates domain-specific success criteria

### Domain-Task
- Task.create → Domain.assign: New tasks are assigned to appropriate domains for context
- Domain.criteria → Task.validate: Domain-specific criteria inform task validation and success conditions
- Domain boundaries → Task.coordinate: Tasks coordinate across domain boundaries when necessary

### Domain-Planning
- Planning.initiate → Domain.assign: New planning contexts are assigned to appropriate domains
- Domain.criteria → Planning.validate: Domain-specific criteria inform plan validation and feasibility
- Planning.decompose → Domain boundaries: Task decomposition respects domain expertise boundaries

### Domain-Delegation
- Domain → Delegation.assess: Domain expertise requirements inform delegation capability matching
- Delegation.transfer → Domain.assign: Delegated work is assigned to appropriate domains for context
- Domain boundaries → Delegation.constraint: Domain limitations become constraints on delegated authority

### Domain-Commitment
- Domain.criteria → Commitment.commit: Domain-specific criteria inform commitment deadlines and acceptance criteria
- Commitment.reschedule → Domain.validate: Commitment changes are validated against domain constraints
- Domain standards → Commitment evaluation: Domain standards guide commitment fulfillment assessment

### Domain-Intervention
- Domain mismatch → Intervention.raise: Requests not fitting existing domains trigger interventions
- Intervention.resolve → Domain.defineCategory: Interventions may result in new domain categories
- Domain boundaries → Intervention: Work crossing domain boundaries may trigger coordination interventions

### Domain-Trigger
- Domain patterns → Trigger: Recurring domain-specific patterns can trigger automated actions
- Domain.assign → Trigger: Domain assignment can trigger domain-specific workflows or notifications
- Domain evolution → Trigger → Domain.addProperty: Domain usage patterns trigger automated domain refinement

### Domain-Interpretation
- Domain.assign → Interpretation.record: Domain assignment records the interpretive context for understanding
- Interpretation.accept → Domain.validate: Accepted interpretations are validated against domain criteria
- Domain evolution → Interpretation.refine: Domain changes may require interpretation refinement

### Domain-SatisfactionCondition
- Domain.assign → SatisfactionCondition.derive: Domain assignment automatically derives conditions of satisfaction
- SatisfactionCondition.declare → Domain.validate: Satisfaction declarations are validated against domain criteria
- Domain.criteria → SatisfactionCondition.update: Domain criteria changes update associated satisfaction conditions
