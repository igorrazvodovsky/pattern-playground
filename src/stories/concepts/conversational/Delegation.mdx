# Delegation

## Purpose

To enable scalable work organization by transferring decision-making and execution
to capable actors while preserving strategic oversight and coordination.

## Operational principle

When an actor (delegator) identifies work that can be effectively accomplished by another actor
(delegate), they assess the delegate's capabilities and trustworthiness, define the scope of
authority being transferred along with success criteria and constraints, formally transfer
responsibility while establishing feedback and oversight mechanisms, monitor progress,
and reclaim authority when the delegation is complete or needs to be revoked.

## State

- delegator: the actor transferring authority and responsibility
- delegate: the actor receiving authority and responsibility
- scope: defined boundaries of delegated authority and responsibility
- authority: degree of decision-making power transferred
- success_criteria: measurable outcomes expected from delegation
- constraints: limitations on delegated authority and required approvals
- oversight: monitoring and feedback protocols
- escalation: conditions and procedures for returning authority to delegator
- trust: assessed reliability and capability of delegate
- performance record: historical outcomes and learning from delegation relationship
- status: current delegation state (proposed, negotiated, active, suspended, completed, revoked)

## Actions

- assess: evaluate delegate capabilities and trustworthiness for specific delegation
- negotiate: establish mutual agreement on scope, authority, and expectations
- transfer: formally convey authority and responsibility to delegate
- monitor: track progress and performance
- support: provide resources, guidance, and assistance as needed
- escalate: transfer specific decisions back to delegator when constraints are exceeded
- adjust: modify scope, authority level, or constraints based on performance
- takeback: reclaim authority to address issues or provide direction
- complete: conclude delegation when objectives are achieved
- evaluate: assess delegation outcomes and update trust and capability assessments

- Task
- Planning
- Commitment
- Domain
- Intervention
- Trigger

{/*
### Planning-Delegation

- Planning.decompose → Delegation.assess: Complex objectives trigger assessment of delegate capabilities for sub-planning
- Planning.analyse → Delegation.negotiate: Resource and capability analysis informs delegation scope and authority levels
- Delegation.transfer → Planning.monitor: Transferred planning authority creates monitoring requirements for the delegator
- Delegation.escalate → Planning.revise: When delegates encounter planning boundaries, original planners revise or expand scope
- Planning.optimise → Delegation.adjust: Plan optimisations may require adjustments to delegated authority and constraints

### Delegation-Task

- Delegation.transfer → Task.assign: Delegated authority enables direct task assignment within the granted scope
- Task.block → Delegation.escalate: Blocked tasks trigger escalation when they exceed delegated decision-making authority
- Task.complete → Delegation.evaluate: Task completion provides performance data for trust and capability assessment
- Delegation.adjust → Task.update: Changes in delegated scope require corresponding updates to task specifications
- Task.fail → Delegation.takeback: Task failures may trigger authority reclamation for direct intervention

### Delegation-Conversation

- Conversation → Delegation.negotiate: Complex conversations may require delegation of authority to capable actors
- Delegation.transfer → Conversation.logEvent: Authority transfers are logged into conversations for transparency
- Delegation.escalate → Conversation.start: Escalations create new conversations with higher authority levels
- Delegation.complete → Conversation.logEvent: Delegation completion is communicated back to stakeholders

### Delegation-Commitment

- Delegation.transfer → Commitment.commit: Delegated authority creates corresponding commitments from the delegate
- Commitment.reschedule → Delegation.adjust: Commitment changes may require delegation scope adjustments
- Delegation.evaluate → Commitment (trust update): Performance evaluation updates trust levels for future delegations

### Delegation-Domain

- Domain → Delegation.assess: Domain expertise requirements inform delegation capability matching
- Delegation.transfer → Domain.assign: Delegated work is assigned to appropriate domains for context
- Domain boundaries → Delegation.constraint: Domain limitations become constraints on delegated authority

### Delegation-Intervention

- Delegation.escalate → Intervention.raise: Authority gaps trigger interventions for resolution
- Intervention.resolve → Delegation.adjust: Intervention resolutions may modify delegation parameters
- Delegation overdue → Intervention: Stuck delegations trigger interventions for unblocking

### Delegation-Trigger

- Task patterns → Trigger → Delegation.assess: Recurring task patterns can trigger automated delegation assessments
- Delegation.complete → Trigger: Successful delegations can trigger similar future delegations
- Authority gaps → Trigger → Delegation.escalate: Systematic authority gaps trigger escalation rules
