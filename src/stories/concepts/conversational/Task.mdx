# Task

## Purpose

To provide a standardized execution container that enables an actor (human or artificial) to receive
work specifications, execute activities, coordinate with related tasks, and provide feedback
while maintaining accountability within hierarchical work structures.

## Operational principle

When an actor receives a task specification with defined objectives, constraints, and context,
they execute the required activities within the specified scope, coordinate with peer and parent tasks
as needed, utilise available resources and capabilities, provide progress feedback to the coordinating
system, and complete execution when all criteria are satisfied and specified outputs are produced.

## State

- specification: the formal or informal description of what needs to be accomplished
- status: submitted, planning, executing, clarifying, completed, failed
- requester: the actor who initiated the task
- fulfiller: the actor responsible for execution
- resources: available tools, information, and capabilities accessible to the actor
- constraints: temporal, resource, quality, or scope limitations
- outputs: artifacts or results produced during execution
- deadline
- startedAt
- progress: measurable indicators of completion degree
- dependencies: explicit predecessor and successor task relationships
- context: reference to originating planning context
- feedback: progress and outcome information for planning system
{/* - adaptability: indicators of which aspects can be modified during execution */}


## Actions

- create: establish a new task with initial specification and constraints
- assign: allocate the task to a specific actor based on capability matching
- start: begin active execution, transitioning from assigned to in-progress
- coordinate: communicate with peer tasks and parent context as needed
- update: modify task specification, constraints, or progress indicators
- report: provide structured progress and status feedback
- block: suspend execution due to dependencies or resource unavailability
- request: ask for clarification, additional resources, or assistance
- resume: continue execution after resolving blocking conditions
- complete: finalize execution when all completion criteria are satisfied
- fail: terminate execution when completion becomes impossible within constraints
- addDependency: establish ordering relationships with other tasks
- removeDependency: eliminate dependency relationships when no longer relevant
- adapt: modify task parameters in response to planning updates


{/*
- `submit(request)`: User provides a task description
- `plan()`: System analyzes request and creates execution strategy
- `execute_step()`: System performs individual work components
- `ask_user(question)`: System requests clarification
- `provide_input(response)`: User supplies requested information
- `complete(results)`: System delivers final outputs
- `fail(reason)`: System terminates task due to inability to proceed
*/}

 {/* ## State transitions */}

{/* Uninitialized → Submitted → Planning → Executing → (potentially Asking → Executing cycles) → Completed/Failed. */}

## Synchronisations

- Conversation
- Planning
- Delegation
- Commitment
- Domain
- Intervention
- Trigger
- Interpretation

{/*
### Task-Conversation
- Task.create → Conversation.start: Creating a task opens a conversation with acceptance criteria and authority
- Task.complete → Conversation.declareSatisfied: Task completion prompts the authority to declare satisfaction
- Conversation.declareSatisfied → Task (accepted): Conversation satisfaction accepts and closes the task
- Conversation.close → Task.fail: Conversations closed without satisfaction mark tasks as failed

### Task-Planning
- Planning.decompose → Task.create: Objective decomposition automatically generates corresponding task hierarchies
- Planning.structure → Task.addDependency: Temporal ordering establishes dependencies between tasks
- Task.report → Planning.monitor: Task progress feeds back to planning for adaptive restructuring
- Planning.revise → Task.update: Plan modifications trigger updates to task specifications and dependencies
- Task.fail → Planning.analyse: Task failures initiate replanning to address obstacles
- Planning.approve → Task.assign: Approved plans enable task assignment to capable actors

### Task-Delegation
- Delegation.transfer → Task.assign: Delegated authority enables direct task assignment within granted scope
- Task.block → Delegation.escalate: Blocked tasks trigger escalation when exceeding delegated authority
- Task.complete → Delegation.evaluate: Task completion provides performance data for capability assessment
- Delegation.adjust → Task.update: Changes in delegated scope require task specification updates
- Task.fail → Delegation.takeback: Task failures may trigger authority reclamation

### Task-Commitment
- Task.assign → Commitment.commit: Task assignment creates corresponding commitments from fulfilers
- Commitment.reschedule → Task.retime: Commitment rescheduling updates task deadlines
- Task.complete → Commitment (review): Task completion prompts commitment review rather than auto-fulfillment
- Task.cancel → Commitment.clear: Task cancellation voids associated commitments

### Task-Domain
- Task.create → Domain.assign: New tasks are assigned to appropriate domains for context
- Domain.criteria → Task.validate: Domain-specific criteria inform task validation and success conditions
- Domain boundaries → Task.coordinate: Tasks coordinate across domain boundaries when necessary

### Task-Intervention
- Task.block → Intervention.raise: Blocked tasks trigger interventions for resolution
- Task overdue → Intervention: Tasks past deadline without completion trigger interventions
- Task.request → Intervention.raise: Fulfiler requests for clarification raise interventions
- Intervention.resolve → Task.resume: Intervention resolutions enable blocked tasks to resume

### Task-Trigger
- Task.complete → Trigger: Task completion can trigger follow-on tasks or conversations
- Task patterns → Trigger: Recurring task patterns can trigger automated task creation
- Task.fail → Trigger: Task failures can trigger retry or escalation rules

### Task-Interpretation
- Task.create → Interpretation.record: New tasks record interpretive acts connecting intent with execution
- Interpretation.refine → Task.update: Interpretation refinements update task specifications
- Task.complete → Interpretation.validate: Task completion validates the interpretation accuracy
