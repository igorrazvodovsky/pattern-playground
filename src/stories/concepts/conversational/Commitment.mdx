# Commitment

## Purpose
Provide a public promise about task completion that others can rely on.
{/* It’s not the task itself (that lives in Task) and it’s not the acceptance of the work (that’s in ConditionOfSatisfaction). Instead, it’s the visible pledge that others can coordinate around. */}

## Operational principle

If a party commits to complete a task and updates progress, others can coordinate their work accordingly
{/* Without commitments, everything is ad hoc and “done when it’s done.” With commitments, you have a shared schedule of promises. */}

## State
- commitments: Task → Date
- committedBy: Task → Actor

## Actions

- commit
- reschedule

## Synchronisations

- Conversation
- Task
- Planning
- Delegation
- Domain
- Intervention
- Trigger

{/*
### Commitment-Task
- Task.assign → Commitment.commit: Task assignment creates corresponding commitments from fulfilers
- Commitment.reschedule → Task.retime: Commitment rescheduling updates task deadlines
- Task.complete → Commitment (review): Task completion prompts commitment review rather than auto-fulfillment
- Task.cancel → Commitment.clear: Task cancellation voids associated commitments

### Commitment-Conversation
- Commitment.commit → Conversation.logEvent: New commitments are logged into conversations for transparency
- Commitment.reschedule → Conversation.logEvent: Commitment changes are communicated to stakeholders
- Conversation.declareSatisfied → Commitment (fulfilled): Conversation satisfaction fulfills associated commitments

### Commitment-Planning
- Planning.approve → Commitment.commit: Approved plans create commitments from assigned actors
- Commitment.reschedule → Planning.revise: Commitment changes may trigger plan timeline adjustments
- Planning.monitor → Commitment tracking: Plan monitoring includes tracking commitment fulfillment

### Commitment-Delegation
- Delegation.transfer → Commitment.commit: Delegated authority creates corresponding commitments from the delegate
- Commitment.reschedule → Delegation.adjust: Commitment changes may require delegation scope adjustments
- Delegation.evaluate → Commitment (trust update): Performance evaluation updates trust levels for future commitments

### Commitment-Domain
- Domain.criteria → Commitment.commit: Domain-specific criteria inform commitment deadlines and acceptance criteria
- Commitment.reschedule → Domain.validate: Commitment changes are validated against domain constraints
- Domain standards → Commitment evaluation: Domain standards guide commitment fulfillment assessment

### Commitment-Intervention
- Commitment overdue → Intervention: Commitments past deadline trigger interventions for escalation or clarification
- Intervention.resolve → Commitment.reschedule: Intervention resolutions may result in commitment rescheduling
- Intervention → Commitment.clear: Some interventions may void commitments when tasks become impossible

### Commitment-Trigger
- Commitment.commit → Trigger: New commitments can trigger reminder or monitoring workflows
- Commitment overdue → Trigger → Intervention.raise: Automated deadline monitoring triggers interventions
- Commitment.fulfill → Trigger: Fulfilled commitments can trigger follow-up actions or notifications

### Commitment-SatisfactionCondition
