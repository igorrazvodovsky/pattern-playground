# Plan

## Purpose

To bridge the gap between objectives and executable work by decomposing complex goals into hierarchical task structures, establishing coordination mechanisms, and adapting the organizational structure based on execution feedback.

## Operational principle

When an actor identifies a desired outcome, they analyse its complexity and scope,
systematically decompose it into hierarchical task structures with appropriate granularity
and coordination requirements, establish execution contexts, monitor execution progress across the hierarchy,
and adaptively restructure the organization as conditions change to maintain progress toward the intended result.

## State

- objectives: defined outcomes or goals to be achieved
- constraints: temporal, resource, dependency, and quality limitations
- resources: available capabilities, tools, information, and actorsde
- task_structure: organizations of work with defined relationships
{/* - coordination_strategies: approaches for managing inter-task relationships */}
{/* - decomposition_rules: Principles and heuristics for breaking down complex work */}
{/* - adaptation_policies: Guidelines for responding to execution feedback */}
- timeline: temporal sequencing and scheduling of activities
{/* - contingencies: alternative approaches for handling uncertainty */}
- status: current plan state (draft, validated, approved, active, obsolete)

## Actions

- initiate: begin planning with initial objective specification
- analyse: assess current state, constraints, and available resources
- decompose: break down complex objectives into manageable components
- structure: establish temporal ordering and dependencies between components
- optimise: refine plan to improve efficiency, reduce risk, or enhance outcomes
- validate: verify plan feasibility
- approve: formally authorise plan for execution
- monitor: track execution progress
- revise: modify plan based on changing conditions or new information
- obsolete: retire plan when no longer relevant or superseded
{/* - coordinate? or a separate concept */}

{/*
### Planning-Task

- Planning.decompose → Task.create: Objective decomposition automatically generates corresponding task hierarchies with specifications
- Planning.structure → Task.addDependency: Temporal ordering and dependencies are established between generated tasks
- Task.report → Planning.monitor: Task progress and performance data feeds back for adaptive restructuring
- Planning.revise → Task.update: Plan modifications trigger corresponding updates to task specifications and dependencies
- Task.fail → Planning.analyse: Task failures initiate replanning to address obstacles or reassess feasibility
- Planning.approve → Task.assign: Approved plans enable task assignment to capable actors

### Planning-Delegation

- Planning.decompose → Delegation.assess: Complex objectives trigger assessment of delegate capabilities for sub-planning
- Planning.analyse → Delegation.negotiate: Resource and capability analysis informs delegation scope and authority levels
- Delegation.transfer → Planning.monitor: Transferred planning authority creates monitoring requirements for the delegator
- Delegation.escalate → Planning.revise: When delegates encounter planning boundaries, original planners revise or expand scope
- Planning.optimise → Delegation.adjust: Plan optimisations may require adjustments to delegated authority and constraints

### Planning-Conversation

- Conversation.start → Planning.initiate: Complex conversation requests trigger planning to decompose work
- Planning.validate → Conversation.logEvent: Plan validation results are communicated to stakeholders
- Planning.approve → Conversation.logEvent: Plan approval is logged for transparency and coordination
- Conversation.declareSatisfied → Planning.complete: Conversation satisfaction completes the planning cycle

### Planning-Commitment

- Planning.approve → Commitment.commit: Approved plans create commitments from assigned actors
- Commitment.reschedule → Planning.revise: Commitment changes may trigger plan timeline adjustments
- Planning.monitor → Commitment tracking: Plan monitoring includes tracking commitment fulfillment

### Planning-Domain

- Planning.initiate → Domain.assign: New planning contexts are assigned to appropriate domains
- Domain.criteria → Planning.validate: Domain-specific criteria inform plan validation and feasibility
- Planning.decompose → Domain boundaries: Task decomposition respects domain expertise boundaries

### Planning-Intervention

- Planning.analyse → Intervention.raise: Resource or capability gaps trigger interventions during analysis
- Intervention.resolve → Planning.revise: Intervention resolutions inform plan modifications
- Planning overdue → Intervention: Stalled planning processes trigger interventions for unblocking

### Planning-Trigger

- Planning.complete → Trigger: Completed plans can trigger execution or follow-on planning cycles
- Planning patterns → Trigger → Planning.optimise: Recurring planning patterns trigger optimisation rules
- Resource constraints → Trigger → Planning.revise: Systematic constraints trigger replanning automation
