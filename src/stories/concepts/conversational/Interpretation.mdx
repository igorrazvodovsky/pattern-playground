# Interpretation

## Purpose

To record and manage interpretive acts that connect an actor’s *intent* with a system’s *understanding*,
ensuring that conditions of satisfaction are grounded in explicit, shared declarations.

## Operational principle

If an actor declares an interpretation of an entity (e.g., “this dress fits”), then that declaration becomes visible
and can be accepted, rejected, or refined by others within the shared background.

## State

- interpretations: Entity -> set (Party * Declaration)
- background: Optional context for meaning
- intentTree: hierarchical user goals
- understandingGraph: system’s inferred tasks
- mapping: alignment between human intent and system tasks
- status: accepted, rejected, refined

## Actions

- record: capture an interpretive act with its context and background
- accept: validate and confirm an interpretation as correct
- reject: decline an interpretation with reasons
- refine: adjust or improve an interpretation based on feedback


## Synchronisations

- Conversation
- Task
- Planning
- Delegation
- Commitment
- Domain
- Intervention
- Trigger

{/*
### Interpretation-Conversation
- Conversation.start → Interpretation.record: New conversations record interpretive acts connecting intent with understanding
- Interpretation.accept → Conversation.logEvent: Accepted interpretations are logged into the conversation for shared reference
- Interpretation.reject → Conversation → Intervention.raise: Rejected interpretations trigger interventions through conversations

### Interpretation-Task
- Task.create → Interpretation.record: New tasks record interpretive acts connecting intent with execution
- Interpretation.refine → Task.update: Interpretation refinements update task specifications
- Task.complete → Interpretation.validate: Task completion validates the interpretation accuracy

### Interpretation-Planning
- Planning.initiate → Interpretation.record: New planning contexts record interpretive acts about objectives
- Interpretation.accept → Planning.validate: Accepted interpretations inform plan validation
- Planning.revise → Interpretation.refine: Plan revisions may require interpretation refinement

### Interpretation-Delegation
- Delegation.negotiate → Interpretation.record: Delegation negotiations record interpretive acts about authority and scope
- Interpretation.accept → Delegation.transfer: Accepted interpretations enable authority transfer
- Delegation.adjust → Interpretation.refine: Delegation changes may require interpretation refinement

### Interpretation-Commitment
- Commitment.commit → Interpretation.record: New commitments record interpretive acts about obligations
- Interpretation.accept → Commitment.validate: Accepted interpretations validate commitment feasibility
- Commitment.reschedule → Interpretation.refine: Commitment changes may require interpretation updates

### Interpretation-Domain
- Domain.assign → Interpretation.record: Domain assignment records the interpretive context for understanding
- Interpretation.accept → Domain.validate: Accepted interpretations are validated against domain criteria
- Domain evolution → Interpretation.refine: Domain changes may require interpretation refinement

### Interpretation-Intervention
- Interpretation.reject → Intervention.raise: Rejected interpretations trigger interventions for clarification
- Intervention → Interpretation.refine: Interventions may lead to interpretation refinement
- Interpretation gaps → Intervention: Missing or unclear interpretations trigger intervention requests

### Interpretation-Trigger
- Interpretation patterns → Trigger: Recurring interpretation types can trigger automated assistance
- Interpretation.reject → Trigger → Intervention.raise: Rejected interpretations trigger clarification workflows
- Interpretation.accept → Trigger: Accepted interpretations can trigger execution or follow-up actions
