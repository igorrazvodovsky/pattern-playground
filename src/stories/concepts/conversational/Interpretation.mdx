# Interpretation

## Purpose

To record and manage interpretive acts that connect an actor’s *intent* with a system’s *understanding*,
ensuring that conditions of satisfaction are grounded in explicit, shared declarations.

## Operational principle

If an actor declares an interpretation of an entity (e.g., “this dress fits”), then that declaration becomes visible
and can be accepted, rejected, or refined by others within the shared background.

## State

- interpretations: Entity -> set (Party * Declaration)
- background: Optional context for meaning
- intentTree: hierarchical user goals
- understandingGraph: system’s inferred tasks
- mapping: alignment between human intent and system tasks
- status: accepted, rejected, refined
