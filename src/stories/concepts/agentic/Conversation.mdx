# Conversation

## Purpose
Facilitate requests and promises between actors, ensuring completion or explicit closure

## Operational principle

If an actor requests an action on a topic and another actor accepts, the conversation remains active until the condition of satisfaction is declared met or the conversation. is closed

## State
- requester
- responder
- topic
- condition
- status: proposed, accepted, active, completed, closed
- history?: optional for audit/transparency

## Actions
- start
- accept
- declareSatisfied
- close
- logEvent

## Polymorphism

- Actor could be user, role, organisation, system, AI, etc.
- Topic could be anything: requests, orders, tasks, etc.

## Synchronisations

- Conversation ↔ Breakdown: If a conversation is closed without meeting its conditions, mark it as a breakdown and possibly start a repair conversation.
- Conversation ↔ Triggering: Finishing one conversation can trigger another (e.g., customer order completion triggers a follow-up survey conversation).
