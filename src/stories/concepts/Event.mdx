# Event

## Purpose

To record what happened so actor can understand and learn from actions, decisions and their outcomes, whether initiated by user, other people, the system, or AI.

## Operational principle

If any actor (user, other person, system, or AI) performs an action that changes the system or produces
an outcome, then an Event is automatically recorded with precise timing and context,
so actor can later trace exactly what happened, when it happened, and who or what initiated it -
enabling actor to understand sequences of actions, debug problems, and maintain accountability across all actors.

## State

- id: Unique identifier for this Event
- timestamp: When the occurrence happened
- type: What kind of occurrence this represents
- actor: Who or what initiated this Event (user, other person, system, or AI)
- details: Relevant context and data about what happened
- urgency: the level of importance or immediacy
- scope?: the context in which the event is relevant (e.g., global, local)

## Actions

- create: Generate a new Event when an occurrence happens
- emit?: Broadcast the Event to interested listeners or systems

## Synchronizations

### With EventLog
When an Event is created, EventLog automatically appends it to maintain chronological order.

### With Notification
When an Event of significant interest occurs, Notification can be triggered to alert users immediately.

### With Task
When Task actions are performed (start, complete, fail), Events are recorded to maintain audit trail of task execution.
