# Delegation

## Purpose

To enable scalable work organization by transferring decision-making and execution
to capable actors while preserving strategic oversight and coordination.

## Operational principle

When an actor (delegator) identifies work that can be effectively accomplished by another actor
(delegate), they assess the delegate's capabilities and trustworthiness, define the scope of
authority being transferred along with success criteria and constraints, formally transfer
responsibility while establishing feedback and oversight mechanisms, monitor progress,
and reclaim authority when the delegation is complete or needs to be revoked.

## State

- delegator: the actor transferring authority and responsibility
- delegate: the actor receiving authority and responsibility
- scope: defined boundaries of delegated authority and responsibility
- authority: degree of decision-making power transferred
- success_criteria: measurable outcomes expected from delegation
- constraints: limitations on delegated authority and required approvals
- oversight: monitoring and feedback protocols
- escalation: conditions and procedures for returning authority to delegator
- trust: assessed reliability and capability of delegate
- performance record: historical outcomes and learning from delegation relationship
- status: current delegation state (proposed, negotiated, active, suspended, completed, revoked)

## Actions

- assess: evaluate delegate capabilities and trustworthiness for specific delegation
- negotiate: establish mutual agreement on scope, authority, and expectations
- transfer: formally convey authority and responsibility to delegate
- monitor: track progress and performance
- support: provide resources, guidance, and assistance as needed
- escalate: transfer specific decisions back to delegator when constraints are exceeded
- adjust: modify scope, authority level, or constraints based on performance
- takeback: reclaim authority to address issues or provide direction
- complete: conclude delegation when objectives are achieved
- evaluate: assess delegation outcomes and update trust and capability assessments

## Synchronization

### Planning-Delegation

...

### Delegation-Task

...

## To do

- Delegation serves as a bridging mechanism that enhances the overall planning-task capabilities
- Planning system can delegate not just task execution but also sub-planning authority, enabling recursive delegation where delegates can further delegate within their granted scope
- The delegation enables coordination of intelligence across different actor types and capability levels.
- Delegation provides mechanisms for systems to evolve trust relationships over time, enabling gradual expansion of delegated authority based on demonstrated capability and reliability. This might create learning systems that become more efficient through accumulated delegation experience.
- Actor-agnostic coordination
