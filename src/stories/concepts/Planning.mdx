# Planning

## Purpose

To bridge the gap between objectives and executable work by decomposing complex goals into hierarchical task structures, establishing coordination mechanisms, and adapting the organizational structure based on execution feedback.

## Operational principle

When an actor identifies a desired outcome, they analyse its complexity and scope,
systematically decompose it into hierarchical task structures with appropriate granularity
and coordination requirements, establish execution contexts, monitor execution progress across the hierarchy,
and adaptively restructure the organization as conditions change to maintain progress toward the intended result.

## State

- objectives: defined outcomes or goals to be achieved
- constraints: temporal, resource, dependency, and quality limitations
- resources: available capabilities, tools, information, and actorsde
- task_structure: organizations of work with defined relationships
{/* - coordination_strategies: approaches for managing inter-task relationships */}
{/* - decomposition_rules: Principles and heuristics for breaking down complex work */}
{/* - adaptation_policies: Guidelines for responding to execution feedback */}
- timeline: temporal sequencing and scheduling of activities
{/* - contingencies: alternative approaches for handling uncertainty */}
- status: current planning state (draft, validated, approved, active, obsolete)

## Actions

- initiate: begin planning process with initial objective specification
- analyse: assess current state, constraints, and available resources
- decompose: break down complex objectives into manageable components
- structure: establish temporal ordering and dependencies between components
{/* - coordinate */}
- optimise: refine plan to improve efficiency, reduce risk, or enhance outcomes
- validate: verify plan feasibility
- approve: formally authorise plan for execution
- monitor: track execution progress
- revise: modify plan based on changing conditions or new information
- obsolete: retire plan when no longer relevant or superseded

## Synchronizations

### Planning-Task

- Task structure creation: when planning decomposes objectives, corresponding task hierarchies are automatically generated with proper specifications and coordination requirements.
- Execution deedback integration: task progress, completion status, and performance data feeds back to planning systems for adaptive restructuring and optimization.
