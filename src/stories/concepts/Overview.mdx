# Concepts

I’m trying out the ideas from Daniel Jackson’s [The Essence of Software](https://essenceofsoftware.com/)—mainly trying to pin down some common concepts and see how they connect to patterns.

Not sure yet if and how to integrate it into my own work proceess.

## Clusters

Clusters group concepts that are topically related.

{/* ### Version control */}

{/* ... */}

### Commerce

...

### Project management

...

### Agentic systems

Shared concepts: decision making, capability boundary management, context management,
exception and uncertainty handling, planning, coordination, learning

- Autonomous agents prioritize reliability and consistency
- Chatbots emphasize understanding and response quality
- Task-execution agents focus on independent completion efficiency
- Collaborative agents balance initiative with partnership

#### Autonomous agents

These agents operate continuously with minimal human intervention, incorporating occasional human takeback or handoff mechanisms when situations exceed their capabilities or require human judgment.

Key concepts: continuous operation, decision making, environmental monitoring, handoff, takeback,
{/* ???: Exception Escalation, Capability Boundaries */}

Unlike other agent types, fully autonomous agents prioritize consistency and reliability over adaptability.

#### Chatbot

Conversational assistant that engage in iterative dialogue, building understanding through back-and-forth interaction
while adapting responses based on conversational context.

Key concepts: conversation, intent recognition, response generation, clarification, knowledge/memory, adaptive tone

#### Task-execution agents

Agents that receive discrete tasks, execute them independently using available tools and capabilities,
and return complete results without/minimal human collaboration during execution

Key concepts: task, execution, tool use, result compilation, clarification, scope, progress transparency

{/* ???: conversation threading, */}

#### Collaborative agents

Agents designed to work alongside humans as active partners, capable of initiating tasks and making independent
progress while proactively seeking human input when encountering uncertainty or complexity.

Key concepts: initiative, collaborative planning, help-seeking, adaptive autonomy
