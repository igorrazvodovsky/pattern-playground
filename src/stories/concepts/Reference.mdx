# Reference

Reference enables users to create structured connections between documents, content,
or data items while maintaining contextual information about those relationships.

## Operational principle

If a user creates a reference from one item to another (through picking, pasting, or manual entry), then the system maintains a bidirectional relationship that can be displayed in multiple formats (preview, detail, full view) and provides contextual navigation between the connected items.

## State

- reference item: the target of the reference
- source context: The location where the reference appears (document, page, or content area)
- creator: User who created the reference

## Actions

- create: Establish a new connection to a target item
- remove: Delete an existing reference
