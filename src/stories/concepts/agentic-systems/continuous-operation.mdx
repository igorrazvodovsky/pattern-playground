# Continuous operation

## Purpose

Keep a delegated task running, at a set cadence, until paused or stopped.
{/* Alt.: Maintain persistent execution of assigned responsibilities without human oversight */}

## Operational principle

After starting a run for a task, the system will, on each beat request execution of the task while the run is active.

## State

- task
- status: active, paused
- cadence
- lastBeat

## Actions

- start
- pause
- resume
- set cadence
- stop
- system beat: occurs when external source produces a tick. When accepted, it requests execution of the associated task.

## Synchronisations

- Register runs with the `TODO:scheduler` when they start; deregister on stop
- Drive beats from scheduler ticks; each accepted beat requests execution
- Reflect cadence updates in the scheduler
- Auto-govern running via policy
{/* TODO: Sync with 'delegation' */}

{/* Notify via 'Notification' on outcomes? No, task itself notifies */}
