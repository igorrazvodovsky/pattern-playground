# Task

## Purpose

To provide a standardized execution container that enables an actor (human or artificial) to receive
work specifications, execute required activities, coordinate with related tasks, and provide feedback
while maintaining accountability within hierarchical work structures.

## Operational principle

When an actor receives a task specification with defined objectives, constraints, and context,
they execute the required activities within the specified scope, coordinate with peer and parent tasks
as needed, utilise available resources and capabilities, provide progress feedback to the coordinating
system, and complete execution when all criteria are satisfied and specified outputs are produced.

## State

- specification: the formal or informal description of what needs to be accomplished
- status: current execution state:
  - uninitialized: No task exists
  - submitted: User has provided a task request
  - planning: System is analysing the request and formulating an approach
  - executing: System is actively performing work using tools and knowledge
  - asking: System requires user clarification or input to proceed
  - completed: Task has been fulfilled and results delivered
  - failed: Task could not be completed due to insurmountable obstacles
- assignee: the actor responsible for execution
- resources: available tools, information, and capabilities accessible to the actor
- constraints: temporal, resource, quality, or scope limitations
- outputs: artifacts or results produced during execution
- progress: measurable indicators of completion degree
- dependencies: explicit predecessor and successor task relationships
- context: reference to originating planning context
- feedback: progress and outcome information for planning system
{/* - adaptability: indicators of which aspects can be modified during execution */}


## Actions

- create: establish a new task with initial specification and constraints
- assign: allocate the task to a specific actor based on capability matching
- start: begin active execution, transitioning from assigned to in-progress
- coordinate: communicate with peer tasks and parent context as needed
- update: modify task specification, constraints, or progress indicators
- report: provide structured progress and status feedback
- block: suspend execution due to dependencies or resource unavailability
- request: ask for clarification, additional resources, or assistance
- resume: continue execution after resolving blocking conditions
- complete: finalize execution when all completion criteria are satisfied
- fail: terminate execution when completion becomes impossible within constraints
- addDependency: establish ordering relationships with other tasks
- removeDependency: eliminate dependency relationships when no longer relevant
- adapt: modify task parameters in response to planning updates


{/*
- `submit(request)`: User provides a task description
- `plan()`: System analyzes request and creates execution strategy
- `execute_step()`: System performs individual work components
- `ask_user(question)`: System requests clarification
- `provide_input(response)`: User supplies requested information
- `complete(results)`: System delivers final outputs
- `fail(reason)`: System terminates task due to inability to proceed
*/}

 {/* ## State transitions */}

{/* Uninitialized → Submitted → Planning → Executing → (potentially Asking → Executing cycles) → Completed/Failed. */}

## TODO: Synchronizations

- Task creation
- Coordination establishment?
- Execution feedback
- Adaptive restructuring

### Precursors

- [Planning](../?path=/docs/concepts-planning--docs): before execution, tasks undergo planning to determine optimal approaches and resource requirements.
- [Agency](../?path=/docs/foundations-agency--docs): defines the system's capability to act independently and make decisions during task execution.

### Follow-ups

- [Bot](../?path=/docs/patterns-intelligence-bot--docs): interprets task specifications and executes work using available tools and capabilities.
- [Transparent reasoning](../?path=/docs/patterns-communication-transparent-reasonining--docs): makes the task execution process visible through step-by-step reasoning.
- [Activity log](../?path=/docs/patterns-content-activity-log--docs): records task actions, progress, and outcomes for review and accountability.

### Components

- [Progress indicator](../?path=/docs/components-progress-indicator--docs): visually communicates task completion status and remaining work.

### Concepts

- [Item](../?path=/docs/concepts-item--docs): individual work artifacts or outputs produced during task execution.
- [Collection](../?path=/docs/concepts-collection--docs): organises multiple related tasks for batch management and coordination.
