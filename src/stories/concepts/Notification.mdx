# Notification

## Purpose

To provide timely and context-appropriate feedback to users about system or actor-driven events and to do so at an appropriate level of disruption.

## Operational principles

1. For Immediate, Critical Actions (Dialog): If a user initiates a
  destructive action with irreversible consequences (e.g., deleting a
  shared project), then a Dialog notification appears, halting their
  workflow and requiring explicit confirmation. This ensures critical
  actions are deliberate and prevents accidental data loss.

2. For Important, Non-Urgent Information (Callout): If a user's
  subscription is nearing its expiration date, then a persistent
  Callout notification is displayed on their main dashboard. It informs
    them of the upcoming event and provides a clear action to upgrade,
  without interrupting their immediate task.

3. For Simple Status Updates (Toast): If a user successfully saves their
    changes, then a transient Toast notification appears briefly to
  confirm the action was completed and then automatically disappears.
  This provides quick, non-intrusive feedback on the outcome of a
  routine action.

4. For Contextual vs. Global Scope: If a user enters an invalid email
  address in a form, then a contextual Inline notification appears
  directly beside the input field to guide correction. Conversely, if a
    system-wide maintenance is scheduled, then a global Callout is
  displayed at the top of every page to ensure all users are aware of
  the upcoming downtime.
