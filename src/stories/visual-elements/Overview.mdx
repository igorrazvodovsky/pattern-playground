# Visual elements

Systematic approaches to appearance and presentation.

Visual elements establish the aesthetic language of the system—how information is rendered, organised, and brought to life through colour, typography, spatial arrangement, and motion. These elements work together to create visual hierarchy, guide attention, and communicate meaning through form.

## Visual elements

- [Color](../?path=/docs/visual-elements-color--docs) - palette systems and semantic meaning
- [Typography](../?path=/docs/visual-elements-typography--docs) - type scales and hierarchy
- [Layout](../?path=/docs/visual-elements-layout--docs) - spatial organisation and grid systems
- [Motion](../?path=/docs/visual-elements-motion--docs) - animation and transition principles

---

Visual elements enable consistent [primitives](../?path=/docs/primitives-overview--docs) and [components](../?path=/docs/components-overview--docs). They interact with [qualities](../?path=/docs/qualities-overview--docs) like [density](../?path=/docs/qualities-density--docs) and [accessibility](../?path=/docs/qualities-accessibility--docs) to shape the overall user experience.
