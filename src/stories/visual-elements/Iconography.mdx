# Iconography

Icons help users find actions faster by providing visual landmarks.

## Differentiation earns its place

An icon only helps if it stands out. Adding an icon to every item removes that advantage&nbsp;— distinction requires variety. If everything has an icon, nothing is easier to find.

## Consistency across contexts

Users learn icon meanings through repetition. The same action (delete, save, close) must use the same icon everywhere it appears. An icon that means one thing in one place and something different in another actively misleads.

## No reuse for different actions

Never use the same icon for two different actions, even in different parts of the interface. If users have learned that an icon means one thing, it must mean that thing everywhere.
