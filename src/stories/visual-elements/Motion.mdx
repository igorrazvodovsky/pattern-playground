# Motion

Motion conveys status, provides feedback and instruction, and enriching the visual experience.

## Purpose

TODO: Providing feedback, guiding user behavior, and adding emotional resonance.

## Frequency of use

The more often something is used, the less animation it needs.


## Perception of speed

Animations have to be fast. This way they improve the perceived performance of the app and stay connected to user’s actions.
