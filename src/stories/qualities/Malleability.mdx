# Malleability

The capacity for users to reshape their tools with minimal friction—from adjusting preferences to building custom workflows.

Where [adaptability](../?path=/docs/qualities-adaptability--docs) describes how the *system* responds to users, malleability describes how easily *users* can reshape the system itself. Both require [agency](../?path=/docs/qualities-agency--docs), but malleability specifically concerns user-driven modification.

## Scope of change

What can be made malleable, from surface to core:

- *UI*: Visual appearance, [layout](../?path=/docs/visual-elements-layout--docs), and presentation. Includes [colour](../?path=/docs/visual-elements-color--docs), [density](../?path=/docs/qualities-density--docs), and [accessibility](../?path=/docs/qualities-accessibility--docs) preferences.
- *Logic*: Behaviour, rules, and automations. [Interaction](../?path=/docs/foundations-interaction--docs) patterns and [views](../?path=/docs/compositions-view--docs).
- *Data*: [Schemas, structures](../?path=/docs/foundations-data-information--docs), and entity definitions.

## Gentle slope

Users progress from passive use to active creation. The goal: each step requires only incremental investment of learning, with no sharp "cliffs" that block progression.

### Use → Configure → Modify → Create

- *Use*: Interact with defaults as provided
- *Configure*: Adjust exposed settings and preferences
- *Modify*: Rearrange, combine, and extend existing elements
- *Create*: Build new views, tools, or workflows

### Avoiding cliffs

Sharp jumps in required skill block progression. MacLean et al. (1990) propose that each incremental increase in tailoring power should require only a small incremental investment of learning.

Key enablers:
- In-place toolchain: Edit where you use, no separate development environment
- Progressive disclosure: Reveal complexity only when needed
- Safe experimentation: Undo, drafts, and previews reduce fear. [Temporality](../?path=/docs/qualities-temporality--docs) enables versioning and history.

### Not everyone needs to reach the top

Most users stay in the lower and middle parts of the slope. "Local developers"—enthusiasts within a team or community—help others climb higher when needed. This enables collaboration between people with different skill levels.

## TODO: Communal creation

Malleability isn't purely individual. Customizations can be shared, and communities can collectively shape their tools.

- Individual modifications become [shareable](../?path=/docs/qualities-shareability--docs) templates
- "Local developers" guide others up the slope
- *Situated software*: tools shaped for specific community needs
- Shared modifications benefit groups, not just individuals

{/* ## Design considerations */}

{/* ### Key tensions */}
{/* - *Friction vs power*: Easy changes are limited; powerful changes require effort */}
{/* - *Stability vs flexibility*: Users need reliable defaults alongside customization options */}
{/* - *Individual vs shared*: Personal tweaks may conflict with team standards */}
{/* - *Exploration vs commitment*: Users need safe ways to experiment before committing changes */}

{/* ### Enabling factors */}
{/* - In-place editing without switching tools */}
{/* - Progressive disclosure of complexity */}
{/* - Safe experimentation through undo, drafts, and previews */}
{/* - Scrappy aesthetic that invites modification (polished interfaces feel "finished") */}
