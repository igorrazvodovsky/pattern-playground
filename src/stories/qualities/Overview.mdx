# Qualities

Behavioral and experiential characteristics of the system.

Qualities describe how the system feels and behaves rather than how it looks. They define the character of interactions, the distribution of control, the adaptability of responses, and the emotional texture of the experience. Unlike visual elements that focus on appearance, qualities concern themselves with the lived experience of using the system.

## Qualities

- [Agency](../?path=/docs/qualities-agency--docs) - distribution of control between system and user
- [Conversation](../?path=/docs/qualities-conversation--docs) - all interaction as dialogue
- [Adaptability](../?path=/docs/qualities-adaptability--docs) - how systems respond to context
- [Malleability](../?path=/docs/qualities-malleability--docs) - how users reshape their tools
- [Shareability](../?path=/docs/qualities-shareability--docs) - state persistence through links
- [Temporality](../?path=/docs/qualities-temporality--docs) - time, rhythm and lifecycle
- [Privacy](../?path=/docs/qualities-privacy--docs) - data protection and transparency
- [Learnability](../?path=/docs/qualities-learnability--docs) - structural support for competence building
- [Density](../?path=/docs/qualities-density--docs) - information compactness and breathing room
- [Formality](../?path=/docs/qualities-formality--docs) - tone and relationship dynamics
- [Accessibility](../?path=/docs/qualities-accessibility--docs) - inclusive design for all users

Qualities emerge through interactions between layers of the system. Decisions about [agency](../?path=/docs/qualities-agency--docs) influence [bot patterns](../?path=/docs/patterns-bot--docs).
Commitments to [conversation](../?path=/docs/qualities-conversation--docs) shape [messaging compositions](../?path=/docs/compositions-messaging--docs). [Malleability](../?path=/docs/qualities-malleability--docs) guides customizable layouts and user preferences.
