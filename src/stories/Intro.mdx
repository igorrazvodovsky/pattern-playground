<h1>Pattern playground</h1>
<p class="lead">This is meant as an exploration of design system ideas. Through both experimental and practical approaches, I try different ways to organise and compose some of the elements of my design practice.</p>

<h2>Objective and approach</h2>

Using the term "design system" is both helpful and misleading. I'm not trying to build one here (i.e. it's impossible without the context of a product/organisation).
The thing I have in mind is more like an [ongoing design systems work](https://24ways.org/2019/there-is-no-design-system/), focusing on process and workflow improvements through decomposition. I guess **I'm using a part of my own design process as a target for design-system-ish organisation**.
{/* Is it weird? */}

In practical terms the objective is to identify and describe smart, reusable patterns while approaching the process like tending a garden &mdash; cultivating ideas over time, refining structures and fostering connections.
{/* TODO: 'garden' needs clarification */}

{/* From a design process perspective, I'm trying to keep an eye on topic of maintenance... */}

On a technical level, it is also a learning exercise. Not all patterns follow the same implementation strategy. Some are kept as CSS-only, others are made into web components.
The aim is to look for structures that are easy to use both in design tools and code. This approach can simultaneously help designers and developers collaborate, help with pattern adoption, and make them more accessible for contribution.

{/* I'm particularly interested in the idea of [HTML web components](https://adactio.com/journal/20618). */}

{/* <p>something about it being descriptive</p> */}

## Structure

> Patterns marked with __*__ are either taking shape now or are in the to-do pile.

{/* Things marked with ðŸš§ are in progress, and ðŸ“… means something is planned. */}

<br />

{/* I'm trying to categorise different patterns based on their relationships to other patterns. */}
{/* This is not THE structure; it is just a practical arrangement that suits my current needs. */}

## Now

A sporadically updated log of current focus.

### April 2025

Mapping out how LLMs integrate into this, looking for patterns that support better, more thoughtful design than a chatbot.

Prototyping with LLMs requires components I don't have yet, so itâ€™s a bit of a scramble.


### March

Continuing with basics. Balancing coding experiments with describing some of the patterns that don't need an implementation.

Exhausted from trying to define cards and lists and all their countless variations. Will need to go back to it later.

### February

Setting up the basics.

### January

First commit.
