<h2>Objective and approach</h2>

Using the term "design system" is both helpful and misleading. Building a complete design system requires the context of a product or organisation, which this project lacks.
This work resembles ongoing design systems practice, focusing on process and workflow improvements through decomposition. *The project uses design practice itself as a target for design-system-style organisation*.
{/* Is it weird? */}

In practical terms the objective is to identify and describe smart, reusable patterns while approaching the process like tending a garden &mdash; cultivating ideas over time, refining structures and fostering connections.
{/* TODO: 'garden' needs clarification */}

{/* From a design process perspective, I'm trying to keep an eye on topic of maintenance... */}

On a technical level, it is also a learning exercise. Not all patterns follow the same implementation strategy. Some are kept as CSS-only, others are made into web and React components.
The aim is to look for structures that are easy to use both in design tools and code. This approach can simultaneously help designers and developers collaborate, help with pattern adoption, and make them more accessible for contribution.

{/* I'm particularly interested in the idea of [HTML web components](https://adactio.com/journal/20618). */}

{/* <p>something about it being descriptive</p> */}

## On LLMs and AI

I didn't set out to make this an AI project. The plan was to stay technology-neutral. But in reality of 2025 it's become a playground for weaving LLM patterns into component-based structures, using design systems as a lens to explore what's emerging.

<br />
<hr />

## Now

A sporadically updated log of current focus.

### November 2025

*Collaboration* and *conversation* have become central this autumn.
I've added [conversation](../?path=/docs/foundations-conversation--docs) as a foundational layer—treating all interaction as coordinated turn-taking.

This led to expanding the [collaboration](../?path=/docs/patterns-collaboration--docs) patterns, particularly around human↔bot dynamics.
The collaboration stages now map how [agency patterns](../?path=/docs/foundations-agency--docs) shift throughout co-creation. I've been particularly interested in how humans elaborate on AI contributions—from surface acceptance to integrative advancement—and what that means for maintaining agency whilst working with generative systems.

### August

This summer I've been using [concept design](http://essenceofsoftware.com/) to tackle LLMs — breaking
AI down into user-facing semantic blocks rather than mapping technology directly to interaction.
This approach feels more promising than my previous attempts, but I haven't built anything with these concepts yet.
It's possible I'm overextending Jackson's methodology, so I might scale back the LLM concept set.

On the practical side, I'm vibing my way through block-based text patterns enabling [collaboration](../?path=/docs/patterns-collaboration--docs):
commenting, [referencing](../?path=/docs/components-bubble-menu--docs), highlighting, etc. Thinking about collaboration led to updating foundations —
I've added [conversation](../?path=/docs/foundations-conversation--docs) and [formality](../?path=/docs/foundations-formality--docs).
Conversation now exists at three levels (foundation, pattern, and concept), which either reflects its central role in interaction design or signals I'm overcomplicating things.
Formality, on the other hand, remains purely inspirational for now—no patterns implementing it yet.

### June

Refining the LLM patterns. The focus continues on making AI interactions more
deliberate and contextual, moving beyond chat toward embedded
intelligence patterns.
- Basic LLM interactions: steadily filling in the details. Describing patterns that shape model's [input](../?path=/docs/patterns-prompt--docs) and [output](../?path=/docs/patterns-generated-content--docs). Where possible (and makes sense), I'm trying to describe these patterns generically, without tying them specifically to AI. I'm not entirely sure yet how useful this approach is, but it seems to spark interesting connections and conversations. Also filling in missing UI components. Added [TipTap](https://tiptap.dev/) to add more interactivity to help with mainly textual patterns.
- Described [embedded intelligence](../?path=/docs/patterns-embedded-intelligence--docs) as an AI integration strategy.
- Next: [task](../?path=/docs/concepts-task--docs) as a building block of agentic interactions.

{/* Thinking about ways to generate UI... */}

### May

I continue building the map of LLM interaction patterns. Right now exploring how user intent gets captured and acted on. There are three interconnected tracks:
1. First, I've pulled apart [chat](../?path=/docs/compositions-messaging--docs) and [bot](../?path=/docs/patterns-bot--docs)—chat is where the [conversation](../?path=/docs/patterns-conversation--docs) happen; the bot is the part that gets things done, often outside the chat. Seeing them separately makes it easier to think about assistants that shift between interface roles: from conversation partner to background actor.
2. This separation reveals that the chatbot implements a cluster of patterns revolving around clear, deliberate user intent provided via [prompt](../?path=/docs/patterns-prompt--docs), and supported by mechanics like prompt guidance and scaffolding, and model switching.
3. This distinction, in turn, points toward another set of patterns—ways to handle unclear intent when the user doesn't or can't say what they want.

{/* To support patterns that work around user's intent, I added [behaviour](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs) as a foundational layer. */}

In April I've read Daniel Jackson’s [The Essence of Software](https://essenceofsoftware.com/) and now want to try using the ideas in practice.
The plan is to define some of the concepts common to most applications.

### April

Mapping out how LLMs integrate into this, looking for patterns that support better, more thoughtful design than a chatbot.

Prototyping with LLMs requires components I don't have yet, so it’s a bit of a scramble.

### March

Continuing with basics. Balancing coding experiments with describing some of the patterns that don't need an implementation.

Exhausted from trying to define cards and lists and all their countless variations. Will need to go back to it later.

### February

Setting up the basics.

### January

First commit.
