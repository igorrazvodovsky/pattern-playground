<h1>Pattern playground</h1>
<p class="lead">This is meant as an exploration of design system ideas. Through both experimental and practical approaches, I try different ways to organise and compose some of the elements of my design practice.</p>

<h2>Objective and approach</h2>
Using the phrase "design system" is both helpful and misleading. I'm not trying to build one here (i.e. it's impossible without the context of a product/organisation). At least not as an artifact/library/deliverable sense of it.
The thing I have in mind is more like an [ongoing design systems work](https://24ways.org/2019/there-is-no-design-system/). Process and workflow improvement through decomposition. I guess **I'm using a part of my own design process as a target for design-system-ish organisation**.
{/* Is it weird? */}

In practical terms the objective is to think and describe some of the smart, reusable patterns and to approach it like a garden.
{/* TODO: 'garden' needs clarification */}

{/* From a design process perspective, I'm trying to keep an eye on topic of maintenance... */}

On a technical level, it is also a learning exercise in web components. I'm particularly interested in the idea of [HTML web components](https://adactio.com/journal/20618).

{/* <p>something about it being descriptive</p> */}
<br />

<h2>Structure</h2>

{/* <p>Normally I would simply call everything a *pattern* because trying to define boundaries between different types of components in a real project with a multidisciplinary team is close to futile. But this is not a real project. Hence this attempt at categorisation.</p>
