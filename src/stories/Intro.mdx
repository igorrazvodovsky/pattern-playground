<h1>Pattern playground</h1>
<p class="lead">This is meant as an exploration of design system ideas. Through both experimental and practical approaches, I try different ways to organise and compose some of the elements of my design practice.</p>

<h2>Objective and approach</h2>

Using the term "design system" is both helpful and misleading. I'm not trying to build one here (i.e. it's impossible without the context of a product/organisation).
The thing I have in mind is more like an [ongoing design systems work](https://24ways.org/2019/there-is-no-design-system/), focusing on process and workflow improvements through decomposition. I guess **I'm using a part of my own design process as a target for design-system-ish organisation**.
{/* Is it weird? */}

In practical terms the objective is to identify and describe smart, reusable patterns while approaching the process like tending a garden &mdash; cultivating ideas over time, refining structures and fostering connections.
{/* TODO: 'garden' needs clarification */}

{/* From a design process perspective, I'm trying to keep an eye on topic of maintenance... */}

On a technical level, it is also a learning exercise. Not all patterns follow the same implementation strategy. Some are kept as CSS-only, others are made into custom elements. I'm particularly interested in the idea of [HTML web components](https://adactio.com/journal/20618).

{/* <p>something about it being descriptive</p> */}

<h2>Structure</h2>

{/* Things marked with ðŸš§ are in progress, and ðŸ“… means something is planned. */}

<br />

{/* I'm trying to categorise different patterns based on their relationships to other patterns. */}
{/* This is not THE structure; it is just a practical arrangement that suits my current needs. */}
