<Meta title="Introduction" />
<h1>Design System Playground</h1>
<p>
This is meant as an exploration of design system ideas. Through both experimental and practical approaches, I try different ways to organise and compose some of the principles and elements of my design practice.
</p>

<h2>Foundations</h2>
<p>Underlying framework that ensures a unified experience. The goal is consistency and efficiency.</p>

<h2>Primitives</h2>
<p>Primitives are low-level components that are the foundational building blocks to more complex compositions.</p>

<h2>Components</h2>
<p>Main UI building blocks.</p>

<h2>Compositions</h2>
<p>Compositions showcase application of components within a larger design context.</p>

<h2>Patterns</h2>
<p>Best practice design solutions for specific user needs.</p>
