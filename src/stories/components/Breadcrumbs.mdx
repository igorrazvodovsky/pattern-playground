# Breadcrumbs

A breadcrumbs component shows where in the app's hierarchy the actor is. Breadcrumbs support [motivated movement](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#motivated-movement) by providing spatial context and enabling efficient backtracking during navigation.

## Long path

When a breadcrumb has more items than it can show, it automatically collapses.

<Story of={ BreadcrumbsStories.LongPath } />

## Advanced

Breadcrumbs can offer additional functionality by putting sibling pages right into the navigation with a `<select>`,
making lateral movement possible alongside the default top-down flow. This supports [browsing](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#browsing) behavior by enabling exploration of related content without losing current context.

## Accessibility
{/* TODO: */}
{/* - A `nav` element with `aria-label="Breadcrumb"` wraps an ordered list to provide a navigation landmark. */}

- The last item in a breadcrumb is a link (rather than plain text) so it's included in the focus order.
- `aria-current="page"` is on the last link to indicate that it's the current page.
- See the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Breadcrumb Example for more details.

{/* ## Design principles */}
{/* **Hierarchical organisation**: Breadcrumbs embody multilevel structure by showing the complete path from root to current location, making system hierarchy visible and navigable. */}
{/* **Modularity**: Each breadcrumb segment is an independent, clickable component that can be combined to create different path lengths without affecting other segments. */}
{/* **Combinatorial logic**: Breadcrumbs work with other navigation patternsâ€”when combined with filters, they show filtered paths; with command menus, they provide context after direct jumps; with sidebars, they clarify position within nested structures. */}

## [Intent & interaction](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs)

Breadcrumbs support [motivated movement](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#motivated-movement)
through spatial context and efficient backtracking. They enable transitions between navigating (direct movement),
re-finding (returning to known content), and browsing (lateral exploration via advanced variants).

### Navigation transitions

- **Navigating â†’ Re-finding**: When actors lose their way, breadcrumbs provide familiar landmarks to return to known contexts
- **Browsing â†’ Navigating**: Advanced breadcrumbs with sibling selection enable precise movement from exploratory browsing
- **Exploring â†’ Navigating**: Breadcrumbs preserve context during exploration, allowing confident return to structured paths

## Related patterns

- [CommandMenu](../?path=/docs/patterns-command-menu--docs) â€“ alternative navigation for transactional search
- [Filters](../?path=/docs/compositions-filtering--docs) â€“ complementary browsing support

- Expanding the breadcrumb by selecting the ellipsis.
