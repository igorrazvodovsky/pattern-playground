# Breadcrumbs

A breadcrumbs component shows where in the app's hierarchy the actor is. Breadcrumbs support [motivated movement](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#motivated-movement) by providing spatial context and enabling efficient backtracking during navigation.

  <Story of={ BreadcrumbsStories.Basic } />
</Canvas>

## Long path

When a breadcrumb has more items than it can show, it automatically collapses.

<Story of={ BreadcrumbsStories.LongPath } />

## Advanced

Breadcrumbs can offer additional functionality by putting sibling pages right into the navigation with a `<select>`,
making lateral movement possible alongside the default top-down flow. This supports [browsing](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#browsing) behavior by enabling exploration of related content without losing current context.

## Accessibility
{/* TODO: */}
{/* - A `nav` element with `aria-label="Breadcrumb"` wraps an ordered list to provide a navigation landmark. */}

- The last item in a breadcrumb is a link (rather than plain text) so it's included in the focus order.
- `aria-current="page"` is on the last link to indicate that it's the current page.
- See the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Breadcrumb Example for more details.

## [Intent & interaction](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs)

## TODO:

- Expanding the breadcrumb by selecting the ellipsis.
- Alt. use priority+

Breadcrumbs support [motivated movement](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#motivated-movement)
through spatial context and efficient backtracking. They enable transitions between navigating (direct movement),
re-finding (returning to known content), and browsing (lateral exploration via advanced variants).
