# Breadcrumbs

A breadcrumbs component shows where in the app's hierarchy the user is.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ BreadcrumbsStories.Basic } />
</Canvas>

## Advanced

Breadcrumbs can offer additional functionality by putting sibling pages right into the navigation with a `<select>`,
making lateral movement possible alongside the default top-down flow.
