# Breadcrumbs

A breadcrumbs component shows where in the app's hierarchy the user is.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ BreadcrumbsStories.Basic } />
</Canvas>

## Long path

When a breadcrumb has more items than it can show, it automatically collapses.

<Story of={ BreadcrumbsStories.LongPath } />

## Advanced

Breadcrumbs can offer additional functionality by putting sibling pages right into the navigation with a `<select>`,
making lateral movement possible alongside the default top-down flow.

<Story of={ BreadcrumbsStories.Advanced } />

## Accessibility
{/* TODO: */}
{/* - A `nav` element with `aria-label="Breadcrumb"` wraps an ordered list to provide a navigation landmark. */}

- The last item in a breadcrumb is a link (rather than plain text) so it's included in the focus order.
- `aria-current="page"` is on the last link to indicate that it's the current page.
- See the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Breadcrumb Example for more details.

## TODO:

- Expanding the breadcrumb by selecting the ellipsis.
- Alt. use priority+
