            Once, in a quiet alley tucked behind a row of crooked brick houses,
            a tiny gray kitten was born beneath a rusted wheelbarrow. Her fur
            was scruffy, her tail comically short, and her meow sounded more
            like a squeaky hinge than anything threatening. Her name, if she had
            one, was unknownâ€”until the day she wandered out from the shadows and
            into the life of a boy named Milo.
