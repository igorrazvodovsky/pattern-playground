# Popover

- Light-dismiss. Clicking outside of the popover area will close the popover and return focus.
- Default focus. Opening the popover makes the next tab stop inside the popover.
- Accessible keyboard bindings. Hitting the esc key or double toggling will close the popover and return focus.
- Accessible component bindings. Connecting a popover element to a popover trigger semantically.

# Positioning
There are two ways to position popovers: one you can use today and one that will be available in the future.

## Now: Floating UI
Floating UI library is used to provide a declarative positioning.

## Later: CSS anchor positioning
...

# Examples

>All examples use anchor positioning and currently it is only supported in Chrome.

## Tooltip

<Story of={ PopoverStories.Tooltip } />

## Toast
...

<Story of={ PopoverStories.Toast } />


## Tooltip-like popover
...

<Story of={ PopoverStories.Popover } />
