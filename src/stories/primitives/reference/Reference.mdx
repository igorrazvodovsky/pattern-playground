# Reference

References enable users to link to entities, documents, or objects within content. Unlike simple hyperlinks, references provide contextual information and maintain relationships between content elements.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ReferenceStories.Reference} />
</Canvas>

## Use cases

- **User mentions** - Reference team members in comments or messages
- **Document linking** - Connect related files, articles, or resources
- **Object references** - Link to projects, tasks, or other structured data
- **Command shortcuts** - Reference available actions or commands
- **File references** - Link to specific files or code snippets

## Implementation

References are implemented using a custom hierarchical navigation system that follows the same pattern as Command Menu and Filtering. The system supports:

- **Dual-mode navigation** - Global browsing then contextual drilling down
- **Progressive disclosure** - Browse categories first, then select specific items
- **Consistent escape handling** - Escape always returns to global view
- **Keyboard navigation** - Full arrow key and Enter support
- **Multiple entity types** - Users, documents, projects, files, and API endpoints
- **Smart search** - Search across names, descriptions, and categories
- **Visual consistency** - Same design patterns as other hierarchical systems

## Unified Hierarchical References

Consistent hierarchical navigation following the same pattern as Command Menu and Filtering systems. Features dual-mode operation, progressive disclosure, and structured search.
