# Reference

References enable users to link to entities, documents, or objects within content. Unlike hyperlinks, references provide contextual information and maintain relationships between content elements.

## User mentions

<Story of={ReferenceStories.Basic} />

## Multiple reference types

<Story of={ReferenceStories.Reference} />

- [Tags](../../primitives/tag--docs) for simple labeling without links
- Reference implements [item view](../../patterns/content/item-view--docs).
