# Inquiry (Agent)

The agent asks the user a question to which it does **not** know the answer in order to capture new information.

```
1. A: Ask for a specific piece of information (slot).
2. U: Provide value â†’ A: Confirm/store.
3. U (Optional): Sequence closer.
```

## When To Use
Collecting missing attributes, preferences, parameters; onboarding forms via conversation.

## Repair affordances
Repeat the question; paraphrase; example of valid input; define technical terms.

## Metrics
Drop-off per slot; correction rate; time-to-complete; data validity rate.
