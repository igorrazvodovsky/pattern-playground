# Extended telling

The agent delivers a multi-part telling (e.g., instructions, narrative, explanation).

## Sequence

1. Announce scope & parts: “I’ll walk you through [topic].”
2. For each step
   - Agent utterance with core content.
   - Support moves (available on demand), e.g. repeat, paraphrase, give an example, or define any key term used.
   - Advance rule: move to the next step only on a **continuer** (e.g. “OK”, “next”, “go on”, “mm-hmm”, 👍).
   - Interrupt rule: if the user gives a *new intent* (e.g., asks “why?”, changes topic/parameters: “use method B”), *pause* *extended telling* and:
      - handle the clarification as *repair* within A3, or
      - collect new data via *A5 information capture*, or
      - switch to *A2 open request* for a new task.
3. Closing step: recap, offer an artifact, and propose next steps.

## Guidance
- Keep each agent utterance short; move detail to *paraphrase* and *example*. TODO: needs alignment with user preference.
- Provide a **progress indicator** and allow “skip/back/stop” at any step.

## Repair Affordances
- Repeat, paraphrase, example, definition at each step.
- Allow *jump-to-step* and quick exit to other activities.

## Metrics
- Step completion/abort rates; dwell time per step.
- Repair distribution (which steps cause trouble).
