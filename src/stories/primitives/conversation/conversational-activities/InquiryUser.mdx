# Inquiry (User)

A user asks a simple question or makes a simple request; the agent provides a direct response.

1. U → A: Inquiry → Fulfillment
2. U (Optional): Sequence closer (“Thanks”, “Got it”).

## Guidance
- Optimise for *minimisation*: answer first, then offer one-tap *next moves*.
- Prefer *explicit evidence* for non-trivial answers (source, timestamp).
- Keep turns short; avoid multi-part instructions (use *extended telling* instead).

## Repair affordances
Repeat, paraphrase, example, definition

## Next moves
Ask a follow-up, see sources, change scope, or start a new activity.

## Metrics
- Adjacency-pair completion rate (Inquiry→Answer)
- Repair rate & time-to-correct
- Evidence uptake (user opens source)
