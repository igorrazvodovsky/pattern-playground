# Open request

A user makes a complex request that typically requires clarification and/or multiple steps.

1. U: Complex request (“Configure a pump for 120 m³/h at 8 bar”).
2. A: Establish scope + ask for constraints (→ *agent inquiry*).
3. A: Plan/confirm next action (“I will size the pump using… Shall I proceed?”).
4. A: Execute or transition to *extended telling* (instructions) as needed.
5. U (Optional): Sequence closer.

## Guidance
- Show a brief intent frame, e.g. goal, constraints, assumptions, sources, risk.
- Prefer *mixed-initiative* clarifications; ask only for missing/ambiguous slots.
- Gate irreversible actions behind an explicit *confirmation*.

## Repair affordances
- One-tap: Repeat · Say it simpler · Example · Define term.
- Support *retroactive repair* (“Apply this correction to the last step”).

## Metrics
- Wrong-action rate before confirmation
- Clarifications per task; completion time
- Accuracy against source-of-truth/tool outputs
