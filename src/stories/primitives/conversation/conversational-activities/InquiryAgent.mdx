# Inquiry (Bot)

The bot asks the user a question to which it does *not* know the answer in order to capture new information.

1. A: Ask for a specific piece of information (slot).
2. U: Provide value → A: Confirm/store.
3. U (Optional): Sequence closer.

This primitive is the building block for [question-driven dialogue](../?path=/docs/patterns-conversation--docs#question-driven-dialogue), where chains of bot inquiries prompt human thinking and elaboration.

## Repair affordances
Repeat the question; paraphrase; example of valid input; define technical terms.

## Metrics
Drop-off per slot; correction rate; time-to-complete; data validity rate.
