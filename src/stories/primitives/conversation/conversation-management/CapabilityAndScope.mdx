# Capability & scope

Make an explicit, concise statement about *what we can do together now* (and what we cannot), establishing expectations and boundaries.

1. A â†’ U: Capability statement scoped to the channel/context (whatâ€™s supported, sources/tools, costs/risks).
2. A: Offer *topic options* or invite a user-proposed topic.
3. U: Choose a topic or ask for something out of scope.
4. A: If in scope, transition to activity; if out of scope, refuse with alternatives or suggest a handoff.

Show evidence or constraints (sources available, data boundaries) when relevant.

## Support & transitions
- If user requests something unsupported, provide safe refusals and nearby options without dead-ends.
- Use *agent repair* to clarify ambiguous scope requests.

## Metrics
Help deflection; out-of-scope request rate; successful redirections.
