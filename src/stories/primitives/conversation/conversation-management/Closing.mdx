# Closing

End the encounter cleanly with an opportunity for last topics.

1. A → U: Check for user last topics** (“Anything else?”).
2. U: Add last topic(s) or decline.
3. A: Address last topic(s) briefly or schedule follow‑ups.
4. A: Deliver last topic.

## When to use
After fulfilling the current goal or when the user signals completion.

## Metrics
“Anything else?” conversion; post-close re-openings; satisfaction/CSAT on closes.

- [Conversation](../?path=/docs/patterns-conversation--docs) — parent pattern
- [Sequence completion](../?path=/docs/primitives-conversation-sequence-management-sequence-completion--docs) — the user's minimal receipt that signals a sequence is done; closing follows when the overall goal is achieved
- [Disengage without closing](../?path=/docs/primitives-conversation-conversation-management-disengage-without-closing--docs) — alternative when the user steps away without a formal close
