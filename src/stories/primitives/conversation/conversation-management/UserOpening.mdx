# User opening

The user initiates the encounter; the agent recognizes the open and aligns quickly to a topic.

1. U → A: Greeting or first move (“Hi”, “I need a quote”).
2. A: Receipt + capability/role (brief), and *topic alignment* (accept the stated topic or offer nearby options).
3. A: Transition into the selected activity (*user inquiry, open request, or agent inquiry*), or request clarification via *agent repair*.

## Support & transitions
- Use *agent inquiry* for missing parameters; *agent repair* for disambiguation.
- If the user changes their mind immediately, allow *abort*.

## Metrics
Time-to-topic; unnecessary clarification rate after user openings; drop-offs before first action.
