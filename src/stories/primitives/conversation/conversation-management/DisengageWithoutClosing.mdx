# Disengage without closing

Allow either party to step away without a formal close (e.g., idle, context switch), keeping state ready for later resumption.

1. U or A: Disengage trigger (idle, multitask, network drop, “hold on”).
2. A: Non-intrusive acknowledgement; save state and provide a resume affordance (e.g., “Pick up where we left off”).
3. A (Optional): Set a gentle reminder or time-bound expiration (with consent).
4. U: Return later → resume at the same step or start a fresh opening.

- Avoid pushy re-engagement; prefer user-initiated resume.
- Show *what’s saved* and how to *change or discard* it.
- For privacy, clearly state what persists and for how long.

## Support & transitions
- On resume, confirm *assumptions/state* and offer to continue or start over.
- If state is stale, propose *opening* re-open or an updated *scope*.

## Metrics
Successful resumes; time-to-resume; stale-state errors; opt-outs of reminders.
