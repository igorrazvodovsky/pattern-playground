# Bot opening

The bot opens the encounter, establishes footing, and proposes the first topic.

1. A → U: Greeting + brief capability/role statement.
2. A: Offer or propose a *topic* and optionally preview next/alt. topics.
3. U: Accept topic or propose a different one.
4. A: Transition into the chosen activity (e.g., *open request*, *information capture*).

- Include optional *welfare check/name request* and *capability giving* where appropriate.
- Ensure accessibility: text + voice greetings, clear affordances.

## Support & transitions
- If user response is ambiguous, use *bot repair*.
- On user refusal, allow *abort* or offer help in a shape of *extended telling*.

## Metrics
First-topic acceptance rate; time-to-first-action; bounce rate after opening.

- [Capability & scope](../?path=/docs/primitives-conversation-conversation-management-capability-scope--docs) — capability giving is often embedded within the opening
- [Open request](../?path=/docs/primitives-conversation-conversational-activities-open-request--docs) — typical first activity after a bot-initiated opening
- [Extended telling](../?path=/docs/primitives-conversation-conversational-activities-extended-telling--docs) — offered on user refusal as an alternative to immediate engagement
- [Abort](../?path=/docs/primitives-conversation-sequence-management-abort--docs) — if the user disengages before reaching the first activity
- [Disengage without closing](../?path=/docs/primitives-conversation-conversation-management-disengage-without-closing--docs) — if the bot re-opens after a prior session was abandoned
