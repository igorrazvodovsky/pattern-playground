# Abort

The user stops an unsuccessful or unwanted sequence.

1. U → A: Abort signal (e.g., “Never mind,” “Stop,” “Cancel”).
2. A: Immediately halt the current sequence; summarize what (if anything) changed.
3. A: Offer safe next steps: start over, choose a different path, or open help.
4. U (Optional): Sequence closer or transition.

- Treat abort as a clean exit with no pressure to continue.
- Offer *non-destructive* options (save draft, keep collected info, undo changes).
- Avoid “are you sure?” unless action is irreversible or costly.

## Repair affordances
Not a repair; provide *undo* and *restore* affordances when relevant.

## Metrics
Abort rate per activity; salvage rate (draft saved, alternate path taken); repeated aborts indicating UX issues.
