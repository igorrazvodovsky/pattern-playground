# User repair

The user signals they didn’t understand the agent’s utterance.

1. U → A: “What do you mean by X?” / “Can you give an example?”
2. A: Provide paraphrase, definition, or example as appropriate.
3. A: Resume the activity at the same step; offer to continue.
4. U (Optional): Sequence closer.

If confusion persists, degrade gracefully to *extended telling* or a visual aid.

## Repair affordances
Paraphrase, definition, example

## Metrics
Understanding repair resolution rate; repeats per concept; time-to-understand; fallbacks to *extended telling*.
