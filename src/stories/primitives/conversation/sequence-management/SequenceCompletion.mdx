# Sequence completion

The user signals the current sequence has **successfully completed**.

1. U → A: Minimal **receipt** in “third position” (e.g., “Thanks,” “Got it,” 👍).
2. A: Brief acknowledgement; *transition* to next activity or offer *projected next steps*.
3. U (Optional): Start a new activity or close (see conversation managment patterns).

## Metrics
Completion without next-move pick; next-move acceptance rate; premature re-prompts.
