# Primitives

Low-level components that are the foundational building blocks to more complex components.

I've found it useful to differentiate between primitives and components based
on their level of specificity. Primitives represent the common user interface patterns,
well-established building blocks with quite standardized implementations: buttons, lists, menus, dialogs, and so on.

Components, on the other hand, are more specialized assemblies designed to address specific challenges.
For instance, adding a tabs-like interface often requires extra thought about context.
In practice the distinction between primitives and components is fuzzy and subjective.

This distinction also helps when thinking about how a component can be broken down into smaller,
more atomic pieces. By identifying the primitives that make up a complex component, we can create
more modular, reusable, and maintainable design systems that scale across different applications
and use cases.
