# Primitives

Low-level components that are the foundational building blocks to more complex components.

I've found it useful to differentiate between primitives and components based
on their level of specificity. Primitives represent the common UI patterns,
well-established building blocks with quite standardized implementations: buttons, lists, menus, dialogs, and so on.

Components, on the other hand, are more specialized assemblies designed to address specific challenges.
For instance, adding a tabs-like interface often requires extra thought about context.
In practice the distinction between primitives and components is fuzzy and subjective.

This distinction also helps when thinking about how a component can be broken down into smaller,
more atomic pieces. By identifying the primitives that make up a complex component, we can create
more modular, reusable, and maintainable design systems that scale across different applications
and use cases.

## Data entry

Capturing information from users. These primitives enable [application & behavioral enactment](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#application--behavioural-enactment), providing the fundamental controls for user input with appropriate validation and feedback.

- [Input](../?path=/docs/primitives-input--docs)
- [Textarea](../?path=/docs/primitives-textarea--docs)
- [Checkbox](../?path=/docs/primitives-checkbox--docs), `TODO:`radio, and `TODO:`toggle
- `TODO:`Select
- `TODO:`Range

Input primitives combine into [forms](../?path=/docs/compositions-form--docs) and other input compositions.

## Metadata & categorization

Labeling and organizing information. These primitives support [sense-making & integration](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#sense-making--integration) by adding semantic layers to content.

- [Tag](../?path=/docs/primitives-tag--docs) - categorization and filtering labels
- [Badge](../?path=/docs/primitives-badge--docs) - status indicators and counts
- [Reference](../?path=/docs/primitives-reference-reference--docs) - citations and source tracking

{/* Metadata primitives appear throughout [cards](../?path=/docs/compositions-card-card--docs), [data views](../?path=/docs/compositions-dataview-dataview--docs), and enable [filtering](../?path=/docs/compositions-filtering-filtering--docs) and [grouping](../?path=/docs/compositions-grouping--docs). */}

## Feedback & communication

Conveying system state and contextual information. These primitives enable [status feedback](../?path=/docs/patterns-status-feedback--docs) and [explanation](../?path=/docs/patterns-explanation--docs) patterns.

- [Callout](../?path=/docs/primitives-callout--docs) - contextual alerts and notifications
- [Popover](../?path=/docs/primitives-popover--docs) - temporary contextual information

{/* Communication primitives participate in [notification](../?path=/docs/patterns-notification--docs) patterns and support progressive disclosure. */}

## Affordances & system feedback

Communicating interactive possibilities and constraints. These primitives make system capabilities and limitations visible.

- [Keyboard key](../?path=/docs/primitives-keyboardkey--docs) - documenting keyboard interactions
- [Overflow](../?path=/docs/primitives-overflow--docs) - indicating hidden content

Affordance primitives support [accessibility](../?path=/docs/foundations-accessibility--docs) and contribute to [progressive disclosure](../?path=/docs/patterns-progressivedisclosure--docs).
