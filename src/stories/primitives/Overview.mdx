# Primitives

Low-level components that are the foundational building blocks to more complex components.

I've found it useful to differentiate between primitives and components based
on their level of specificity. Primitives represent the common UI patterns,
well-established building blocks with quite standardized implementations: buttons, lists, menus, dialogs, and so on.

Components, on the other hand, are more specialized assemblies designed to address specific challenges.
For instance, adding a tabs-like interface often requires extra thought about context.
In practice the distinction between primitives and components is fuzzy and subjective.

This distinction also helps when thinking about how a component can be broken down into smaller,
more atomic pieces. By identifying the primitives that make up a complex component, we can create
more modular, reusable, and maintainable design systems that scale across different applications
and use cases.

## Data entry

Capturing information from users. These primitives enable [application & behavioral enactment](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#application--behavioural-enactment), providing the fundamental controls for user input with appropriate validation and feedback.

- [Input](../?path=/docs/primitives-input--docs)
- [Textarea](../?path=/docs/primitives-textarea--docs)
- [Checkbox](../?path=/docs/primitives-checkbox--docs), `TODO:`radio, and `TODO:`toggle
- `TODO:`Select
- `TODO:`Range

Input primitives combine into [forms](../?path=/docs/compositions-form--docs) and other input compositions.

## Metadata & categorization

Labeling and organizing information. These primitives support [sense-making & integration](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#sense-making--integration) by adding semantic layers to content.

- [Tag](../?path=/docs/primitives-tag--docs) - categorization and filtering labels
- [Badge](../?path=/docs/primitives-badge--docs) - status indicators and counts
- [Reference](../?path=/docs/primitives-reference-reference--docs) - citations and source tracking
- [Deep linking](../?path=/docs/primitives-deep-linking--docs) - direct access to specific states

## Conversation

Building blocks for constructing conversational flows.

### Conversational activities

Conversational activities consist of basic interaction patterns,
including the user asking the bot a question through [inquiry](../?path=/docs/primitives-conversation-conversational-activities-inquiry-user--docs),
the user making an [open request](../?path=/docs/primitives-conversation-conversational-activities-open-request--docs),
the bot doing [extended telling](../?path=/docs/primitives-conversation-conversational-activities-extended-telling--docs) such as giving instructions or explanations,
and the bot asking the user a question through [inquiry](../?path=/docs/primitives-conversation-conversational-activities-inquiry-bot--docs) to gather information or clarify understanding.

### Sequence management

While activity patterns make up the primary activities of a conversation space,
sequence management patterns enable user and bot to manage those activities:
patterns for [bot repair](../?path=/docs/primitives-conversation-sequence-management-bot-repair--docs) of its own concerns in understanding,
for [user repair](../?path=/docs/primitives-conversation-sequence-management-user-repair--docs) of their understanding issues, for users to signal [sequence completion](../?path=/docs/primitives-conversation-sequence-management-sequence-completion--docs), and for users to [abort](../?path=/docs/primitives-conversation-sequence-management-abort--docs) an unsuccessful sequence.

### Conversation management

Conversation-level management patterns enable actors to coordinate the initiation and ending of the encounter. They provide ways for the bot to [open the conversation](../?path=/docs/primitives-conversation-conversation-management-opening-bot--docs), for the user to [open the conversation](../?path=/docs/primitives-conversation-conversation-management-opening-user--docs), discuss [capability and scope](../?path=/docs/primitives-conversation-conversation-management-capability-and-scope--docs) of what they can do together, and ways to end the conversation by [closing](../?path=/docs/primitives-conversation-conversation-management-closing--docs) it or by [disengaging without closing](../?path=/docs/primitives-conversation-conversation-management-disengage-without-closing--docs).

{/* Metadata primitives appear throughout [cards](../?path=/docs/compositions-card-card--docs), [data views](../?path=/docs/compositions-dataview-dataview--docs), and enable [filtering](../?path=/docs/compositions-filtering-filtering--docs) and [grouping](../?path=/docs/compositions-grouping--docs). */}

## Feedback & communication

Conveying system state and contextual information. These primitives enable [status feedback](../?path=/docs/patterns-status-feedback--docs) and [explanation](../?path=/docs/patterns-explanation--docs) patterns.

- [Callout](../?path=/docs/primitives-callout--docs) - contextual alerts and notifications
- [Popover](../?path=/docs/primitives-popover--docs) - temporary contextual information

{/* Communication primitives participate in [notification](../?path=/docs/patterns-notification--docs) patterns and support progressive disclosure. */}

## Affordances & system feedback

Communicating interactive possibilities and constraints. These primitives make system capabilities and limitations visible.

- [Keyboard key](../?path=/docs/primitives-keyboardkey--docs) - documenting keyboard interactions
- [Overflow](../?path=/docs/primitives-overflow--docs) - indicating hidden content

Affordance primitives support [accessibility](../?path=/docs/foundations-accessibility--docs) and contribute to [progressive disclosure](../?path=/docs/patterns-progressivedisclosure--docs).
