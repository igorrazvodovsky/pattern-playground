# Primitives

Low-level components that are the foundational building blocks to more complex components.
In practice the distinction between primitives and components is fuzzy and subjective.

The main benefit of having 'primitives' is that it splits things into two smaller, more manageable piles.
It also helps when thinking about how a component can be broken down into smaller, more atomic pieces.
