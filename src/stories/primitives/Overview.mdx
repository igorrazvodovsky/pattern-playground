# Primitives

Low-level components that are the foundational building blocks to more complex components.
In practice the distinction between primitives and components is fuzzy and subjective.

In my work, I've found it useful to differentiate between primitives and components based
on their level of specificity. Primitives represent the fundamental,
well-established building blocks with quite standardized implementationsâ€”e.g.,
I rarely need to design another button. Components, on the other hand, are more specialized
assemblies designed to address specific challenges. For instance, adding a tabs-like
interface often requires extra thought about context.

This distinction also helps when thinking about how a component can be broken down into smaller,
more atomic pieces. By identifying the primitives that make up a complex component, we can create
more modular, reusable, and maintainable design systems that scale across different applications
and use cases.
