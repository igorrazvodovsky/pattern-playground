# Pattern name

Description. For standard patterns, this is more or less unnecessary (i.e., it will mostly repeat what everyone already knows).
However, it's useful for explaining diverse implementations of flexible patterns.

When makes sense, the description should be relational – defining a pattern based on its relations and position within the system, rather than static properties. Relational definition will reflect a deeper underlying pattern.

## When to use

### Use case ×N

Use case details...

## Anatomy

The structural breakdown of a pattern into its constituent parts, describing their roles and relationships. Might be useful for complex stuff.

## Variants

Functional, contextual, accessibility and other variants.

## States

Empty, validation, loading, etc.

## Examples of usage

How it works together with other patterns and functions within larger compositions.

## Best practices

Things to do, stuff to avoid.

## Acessibility

How to, corcerns, things to keep in mind.

## Decision tree: when to use what

The logic behind pattern usage and variant selection.

## Related patterns

**Precursors** — patterns that are typically implemented before this one, or that establish foundational conditions for it.

**Follow-ups** — patterns that are commonly used after this one or build on its outcomes.

**Complementary** — patterns that frequently co-occur with this one to support the same user goal or experience.

**Tangentially related** — patterns that address different problems but have conceptual or structural similarities worth noting.
