# Foundations

- Basic structures that ensure a unified experience.
- The goal is consistency and efficiency.
- Automate everything you can: colour palettes, typography scales, spacing scales, etc.
- Look for a useful level of formalism.
- Try to do more with less. Restrictions breed creativity and all that.
