# Foundations

The substrate upon which everything else is built.

## Core

These establish the conceptual framework, creating context for visual, information and interaction design.

- [Principles](../?path=/docs/foundations-principles--docs) - basic beliefs guiding design decisions
- [Agency](../?path=/docs/foundations-agency--docs) - distribution of control between system and user
- [Conversation](../?path=/docs/foundations-conversation--docs) - all interaction as dialogue
- [Adaptation](../?path=/docs/foundations-adaptation--docs) - how systems respond to context
- [Shareability](../?path=/docs/foundations-shareability--docs) - state persistence through links

## Mostly visual stuff

Systematic approaches to appearance and presentation.

- [Colour](../?path=/docs/foundations-color--docs) - palette systems and semantic meaning
- [Typography](../?path=/docs/foundations-typography--docs) - type scales and hierarchy
- [Layout](../?path=/docs/foundations-layout--docs) - spatial organisation and grid systems
- [Density](../?path=/docs/foundations-density--docs) - information compactness and breathing room
- [Motion](../?path=/docs/foundations-motion--docs) - animation and transition principles

*Visual consistency emerges from these systematic choices, enabling interaction patterns.*

## Primarily matters of interaction

How users engage with and perceive the system.

- [Interaction](../?path=/docs/foundations-interaction--docs) - fundamental interaction patterns and behaviours
- [View](../?path=/docs/foundations-view--docs) - framing and presenting information
- [Formality](../?path=/docs/foundations-formality--docs) - tone and relationship dynamics
- [Accessibility](../?path=/docs/foundations-a11y--docs) - inclusive design for all users

*These shape the quality of the experience, informing the construction of primitives and components.*

Foundations cascade through every layer of the system. Decisions about [agency](../?path=/docs/foundations-agency--docs) influence [bot patterns](../?path=/docs/patterns-bot--docs). Commitments to [conversation](../?path=/docs/foundations-conversation--docs) shape [messaging compositions](../?path=/docs/compositions-messaging--docs).
Approaches to appearance and presentation enable consistent [primitives](../?path=/docs/primitives-overview--docs) and [components](../?path=/docs/components-overview--docs).
