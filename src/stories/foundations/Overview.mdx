# Foundations

Core conceptual frameworks creating context for visual, information and interaction design.

Foundations establish the intellectual substrate of the design system—the principles, structures, and interaction models that inform everything built upon them. They define how information is organised, how people engage with the system, and how collaboration unfolds.

## Foundations

- [Principles](../?path=/docs/foundations-principles--docs) - basic beliefs guiding design decisions
- [Information architecture](../?path=/docs/foundations-information-architecture--docs) - organising and structuring content
- [Data & information](../?path=/docs/foundations-data-information--docs) - structure and meaning of data
- [Intent & interaction](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs) - fundamental interaction patterns and behaviours
- [Collaboration](../?path=/docs/foundations-collaboration--docs) - working together within the system

---

These foundations cascade through every layer of the system, shaping [patterns](../?path=/docs/patterns-overview--docs), [compositions](../?path=/docs/compositions-overview--docs), and [components](../?path=/docs/components-overview--docs).
