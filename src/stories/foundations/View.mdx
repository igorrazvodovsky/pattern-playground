# View

Views are purposeful framings of data that make information legible for specific needs and contexts. Rather than presenting data in a single fixed way, the system enables fluid navigation across multiple dimensions of representation.

## User needs

- Access information at the right granularity for their current task without losing context
- Navigate seamlessly between overview and detail without disorientation
- Frame data according to their immediate purpose (monitoring, analysis, investigation)
- Maintain recognition of entities across different representations
- Define and persist useful framings for repeated tasks

## Framing dimensions

Views vary along several independent dimensions that combine to create appropriate representations:

### Scope
- **Single item:** Focus on one entity with varying levels of detail
- **Collection:** Display multiple items with tools for comparison and exploration

### Granularity
The semantic level of information shown:
- **Reference:** Identification and linking (name, type)
- **Summary:** Quick assessment without leaving current context (key attributes, status)
- **Detail:** Relevant information for current task (task-specific data)
- **Full:** Complete information with history and relationships

### Intent
The purpose driving the view selection:
- **Monitoring:** Track operational data and maintain situational awareness
- **Analysis:** Compare and explore to draw conclusions
- **Drilldown:** Investigate specific entities by progressively narrowing focus

### Time
- **Snapshot:** Current state
- **Trend:** Changes over time
- **History:** Complete record and evolution

## Navigation mechanisms

Users navigate between views through various mechanisms:
- Links and menu items for discrete navigation between pages or sections
- [Semantic zoom](../?path=/docs/patterns-semantic-zoom--docs) for density-preserving transitions
- Expand/collapse controls for progressive disclosure
- Modal and drawer triggers for contextual overlays
- Breadcrumbs and back navigation for hierarchical traversal

The choice of mechanism depends on the relationship between views and the need to preserve spatial context.

## Implementation patterns

The view system manifests through several compositional patterns:

- [Item view](../?path=/docs/compositions-item-view--docs) - Single-entity representations across semantic levels
- [Data view](../?path=/docs/compositions-data-view--docs) - Collection representations with filtering, sorting, and grouping

## Saved views

Views can be persisted to reduce friction for repeated tasks:
- **Default views:** Developers define framings aligned with core use cases
- **Role-specific views:** Administrators configure shared views for teams or departments
- **Personal views:** End users create framings tuned to their individual workflows

Saved views capture the complete framing: scope, granularity, filters, sort order, visible attributes, and layout.
