<Meta title="Foundations/Adaptation" />

> ðŸ¤¯ **Fun meter: 5/5**. I'm working on how to frame the integration of LLMs into design systems in a way that's both flexible and useful.
Iâ€™m treating adaptation as tech-agnostic at its core, but also using it as a scaffold for LLM-related patterns.
I've also chosen to blend adaptation with prediction/generation, since theyâ€™re tightly connected in most of my work.
Does this make sense? I'm not sure.

# Adaptation

a systemâ€™s capacity to modify its behavior, presentation, or output in response to user input, context, or inferred intent.
It spans both deterministic (rule-based) and probabilistic (prediction- or generation-based) responses.

## Types of adaptation

### Deterministic adaptation

UI changing based on app state, user preferences, roles, etc. Systems reacting to user inputs or past behaviors in predictable ways.
If X happens, then Y will happen. You can still miss when a user has different expectations, but at least the system is consistent.

### Probabilistic adaptation

Predictions, inference, or generated responses rather than fixed rules. It is driven by ðŸ¤– models and produces context-sensitive results that may varyâ€”even given the same input.

## Things to consider

- User model: the requirements for understanding the user and their context of use are much higher in adaptive systems
- Personalised response: adaptive systems go beyond static functionality, tailoring their responses to individual users and their specific needs
- Beware the bubble: adaptive systems should be able to handle new situations and user needs, even when these deviate from established patterns
