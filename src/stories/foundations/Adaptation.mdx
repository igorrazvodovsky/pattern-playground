<Meta title="Foundations/Adaptation*" />

> ðŸ¤¯ **Fun meter: 5/5**. I'm working on how to frame the integration of LLMs into design systems in a way that's both flexible and useful.
Iâ€™m treating adaptation as tech-agnostic at its core, but also using it as a scaffold for LLM-specific patterns.
I'm also blending adaptation with prediction and generation, since theyâ€™re tightly connected in most of my work.

# Adaptation

Capability of a system to anticipate user intentions and dynamically adjust interfaces,
interactions, and information presentation accordingly. It integrates prediction with responsive adaptation.

## Deterministic vs. probabilistic experience

### Deterministic

Buttons, menus, forms, and flowsâ€”these familiar patterns help structure information and offer a sense of orientation and possibility.

Adaptation (when there is one) happens according to predefined rules.

### Probabilistic

...

### Interplay between deterministic and probabilistic

...

## Relationships to different levels of design system

### Components

### Compositions

### Patterns

## Things to consider

- User model: the requirements for understanding the user and their context of use are much higher in adaptive systems
- Personalised response: adaptive systems go beyond static functionality, tailoring their responses to individual users and their specific needs
- Beware the bubble: adaptive systems should be able to handle new situations and user needs, even when these deviate from established patterns
