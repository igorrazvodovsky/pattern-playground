# Adaptation

Ability to personalize experiences based on user behavior and context.

## Things to consider

- User model: the requirements for understanding the user and their context of use are much higher in adaptive systems.
- Personalised response: adaptive systems go beyond static functionality, tailoring their responses to individual users and their specific needs.
- Beware the bubble: adaptive systems should be able to handle new situations and user needs, even when these deviate from established patterns.
