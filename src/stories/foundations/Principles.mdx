# Principles

## Embracing complexity

Design patterns contain inherent ambiguity and multiple valid paths of combining them. Rather than forcing singular approaches, embrace the fuzziness.

- Allow multiple configurations or interaction pathways to lead to similar outcomes
- Acknowledge that pattern combinations can have different results depending on context
- Enable multiple patterns to solve the same user need

## Modular composability

Modularity is the lever against complexity. Create independent, reusable components that combine in multiple ways to generate complex behaviours. The power emerges from interactions between components, not individual complexity.

- Design components that can be modified or replaced independently
- Enable pattern recombination without breaking existing functionality
- Let complex behaviours emerge from simple component interactions
- Support users adapting and combining patterns to match their workflows

## Multilevel, multidirectional, and hierarchical organisation

Patterns exist at different levels of abstraction, each with its own logic. Understanding requires examining multiple scales.

- Meaning exists at multiple levels of magnification
- Each level in the hierarchy has its own rules, independent of fine details below
- Influences propagate through these levels in both directions

## Temporality and adaptation

Experience unfolds over time.

- Choose which patterns appears *when* to grow capability without breaking the flow.
- Show history and let the system adapt to users' recurrent actions
- Support temporal scaffolding where initial guidance can fade as competence develops
