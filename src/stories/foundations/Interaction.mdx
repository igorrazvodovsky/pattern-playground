# Intent & Interaction

How actors navigate through information and take action within systems. This foundation separates movement behaviours (how actors find and discover) from action behaviours (how actors decide and complete tasks), providing structured guidance for choosing components and patterns that support both exploration and execution.

## Seek–Use–Share

A temporal framework organizing behaviours across the complete journey. It provides the overarching narrative structure that connects navigation and action patterns.

### Trigger & need recognition

Actor intent: recognizing gaps and opportunities.

TODO: Patterns: ...

### Seeking & access

Actor itent: retrieving and gathering relevant information.

TODO: Patterns: Search, Filters, Command menu

### Evaluation & relevance construction

Actor intent: assessing relevance and value.

TODO: Patterns: Previews, Comparison views, Reviews & ratings.

### Sense-making & integration

Actor intent: synthesizing and organizing insights.

TODO: Patterns: Annotation tools, Collection builders, Linking and tagging.

### Application & behavioural enactment

Actor intent: taking decisions, completing tasks.

TODO: Patterns: buttons, confirmation dialogues, undo.

### Sharing, feedback, & iterative learning

Actor intent: communicating outcomes, adapting future behaviors.

TODO: Patterns: share, comment thread, feedback loop, reflective summaries.

## Navigation

Behaviours are organised into four broad categories—each containing behaviour sets that reflect the actor's intent, motivation, and level of confidence.

### Motivated movement

Purposeful progress through a known or emerging structure. The actor is motivated by a specific outcome, and although the level of precision may vary, the intent is directional. Feedback from the system reinforces progress, and transitions often emerge as clarity and confidence increase.

{/* TODO: compare with: */}
{/* Movement implies that an actor can judge their progress. Their motion through a structure gives them a sense of achievement as they move towards satisfying their need. */}
{/* Their behaviour has a pre-defined goal – occasionally vague or coarse, but nonetheless directed. */}



#### Navigating

Movement with precision and high intent. The actor knows both what they’re looking for and how the structure is likely organised.
Success is driven by targeting (choosing a specific goal) and predictive understanding of the structure.

{/* TODO: compare with: */}

{/* Navigation describes a mode of interaction where the actor moves through a system with purpose and precision. Following Ramsden,
I use the term *navigating* to describe a type of highly directed *browsing*. They know what they want, and where they need to go.
It’s a highly intentional activity driven by a clear target in mind.

Before actor begins, they often already pinpointed their focus (a step Ramsden calls “targeting”), even if it happens unconsciously.
With that target defined, the behaviour follows ordered information-seeking strategies. They either understand the structure or can predict
it accurately, and that mental map lets them navigate swiftly and efficiently.

Along the way, they might briefly *sweep* the environment—scanning broadly to reassure themselves they’re on the right track—but these moments are confirmations, not detours.
Because *navigation* combined a precise intent with a solid grasp of the space, every step carries actor closer to their goal with minimal friction. */}

##### Transitions
Can emerge from browsing when confidence increases, or from transactional search when results are explored.

##### Related patterns

**Structural compositions that enable navigating:**
- [Fully connected](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-fully-connected--docs) — maximum efficiency for precise movement
- [Multilevel tree](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-multilevel-tree--docs) — efficient when mental model matches structure
- [Pyramid](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-pyramid--docs) — hub enables direct targeting

**UI patterns:**
- Navigation is used at the very start of a session.
– Tree for lateral and vertical movement.
- Breadcrumbs show the travelled path and lets actors return (or go sideways).
- Contextual actions — localised controls ("edit", "share", "export") tied to the reached content.
- Related content links that leverage the current location to propose a subsequent path.
- Bookmark captures the reached node for later re-finding.
- Command bar – jumps anywhere.
- Bot
- Filtering trims large sets rather than switching sections, but actors mentally treat every filter change as a micro-navigation.
{/* - Detail view — the destination template (article, product page, data sheet). success of navigating is measured here; appears one step after the hop. */}


#### Browsing

Less precise but still purposeful movement. The actor works within a known part of the system, refining both their goal and their understanding as they go.
They engage in sweeping (broad scanning) to reveal patterns or next steps. Browsing supports learning-in-action, often serving as a bridge between low and high precision behaviours.

##### Transitions
Can sharpen into navigating, or loosen into exploring if uncertainty grows.

##### Related patterns

**Structural compositions that support browsing:**
- [Pyramid](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-pyramid--docs) — overview enables pattern recognition
- [Multilevel tree](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-multilevel-tree--docs) — structured exploration within sections

**UI patterns:**
- Filtering and grouping
- Progressive disclosure | auto-load plus expanding details. | keeps sweep motion fluid; prevents premature transitions.
- Semantic highlight – LLM spots entities and highlights them in views. Speeds pattern-spotting and helps shift into monitoring.
- Timeline
– Tree for lateral and vertical movement.

#### Transactional search

A focused, tool-based method for retrieving specific results. The actor constructs inputs (queries, filters, prompts) with care and intention,
relying on the system to evaluate, discriminate, and deliver. This is not exploratory—interrupting or failing to deliver damages trust.
Transitions out of this mode are usually unwanted, unless the actor gives up and switches strategies.

##### Transitions
Navigational transitions are discouraged – switching into browsing or navigating can feel like system failure unless clearly supported. Successful search results in doing the job.

##### Related patterns

**Structural compositions that optimise transactional search:**
- [Step by step](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-step-by-step--docs) — guided completion without distraction
- [Flat navigation](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-flat-navigation--docs) — sustained focus on work

**UI patterns:**
- Search or command bar

{/* ### Browsing to Navigating */}

{/* ... */}

### Delightful discovery

Discovery happens when actors encounter information they didn’t explicitly seek—but which they find valuable, relevant, or exciting.
This category rewards designs that support curiosity, enable surprise, and create psychological safety for getting a little lost.
Transitions often depend on motivation and momentary clarity of purpose.

#### Exploring

Movement through loosely bounded content or ideas, often triggered by a vague goal or simply curiosity. The actor’s understanding of both the content
and their own need sharpens as they go. Sweeping dominates early stages; conditioning emerges as patterns form.
Exploration can either settle into more directed behaviour or remain open-ended.

##### Transitions
May mature into browsing or navigating once a goal crystallises

##### Related patterns

**Structural compositions that enable exploring:**
- [Pan and zoom](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-pan-and-zoom--docs) — spatial exploration feels natural
- [Fully connected](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-fully-connected--docs) — freedom to follow curiosity

**UI patterns:**
- Personalisation – enables "start somewhere sensible" rather than dumping the actor at a generic wall.
- "Focus & context" shifts actor into browsing.
- Breadcrumbs preserves context so the next hop can be precise navigating if curiosity crystallises.

#### Monitoring

A strategy for staying updated about known areas of interest. Can be active (manual checks) or passive (automated updates).
Monitoring creates continuity over time and can either lead to deeper engagement or enable light, ongoing awareness.
It’s a low-friction way to maintain relevance and context.

##### Transitions

Can lead into exploring, transactional search, or navigating when something changes or catches attention.

#### Passive discovery

Serendipitous encounters with unexpected relevance. The actor may not have been looking for anything, but good design sparks interest,
prompting targeting and movement almost simultaneously. This is where systems surprise and delight—turning idle moments into value.

##### Transitions

Often initiates movement or exploration; can also feed directly into the "job".

### Foggy finding

Here, the actor knows what they want, but can’t access it easily. This friction may stem from memory gaps, unclear structures, or unhelpful tools.
The risk is high frustration, especially when actors believe the system is “hiding” something from them.
Transitions here are about either clarifying the goal or improving system feedback to allow escape into more fluent modes.

#### Re-finding

The actor wants to return to something they’ve seen before, but lacks the exact pathway. They rely on cues, memory, or system support (like history or recognisable patterns). This mode rewards good differentiation, meaningful labels, and predictable paths.

##### Transitions
May evolve into navigating or transactional search if memory strengthens

##### Related patterns

**Structural compositions that aid re-finding:**
- Any model with clear structure and good wayfinding helps
- [Multilevel tree](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-multilevel-tree--docs) — hierarchy provides memory cues

**UI patterns:**
- Recently accessed, activity history

#### Uncovering

Systematic trial-and-error. The actor is motivated but blocked by structural opacity or unclear interaction rules.
This is often a sign of poor affordance or overly strict syntax (e.g. voice commands, search logic).
Good design reduces the opacity of systems to make uncovering unnecessary.

##### Transitions
May improve into transactional search or navigating when actor figures out "how the system thinks"

##### Related patterns

**Structural compositions that mitigate uncovering:**
- [Fully connected](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-fully-connected--docs) — transparency reduces opacity
- Avoid opaque [hub and spoke](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-hub-and-spoke--docs) implementations

#### Hunting

Similar to uncovering but more adaptable and determined. The actor doesn’t care where the solution comes from—only that they find it.
They may use multiple strategies simultaneously (search, scanning, filtering, backtracking). This is an intense,
high-motivation behaviour that thrives when systems reward skill and persistence.

##### Transitions
Can resolve into navigating or browsing; if prolonged, risks frustration or abandonment

##### Related patterns

**Structural compositions that support hunting:**
- [Fully connected](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-fully-connected--docs) — multiple navigation paths available
- TODO: Search

## Actions

Task completion behaviours that bridge navigation and outcomes. Five categories address how systems support decision-making, from establishing readiness through managing consequences. These patterns ensure actors can move from discovery to completion with confidence and appropriate commitment levels.

### Prerequisites to action

Conditions that must be satisfied before an actor can take meaningful action. The system evaluates readiness—whether required information is available, permissions are granted, or dependencies are met. Clear prerequisite communication prevents frustration and builds confidence by showing actors exactly what they need to proceed.

##### Transitions
Successful prerequisite satisfaction leads to encouragement or direct instruction phases.

##### Related patterns
- Form validation states – real-time feedback on completion requirements
- Permission gates – role-based access controls with clear messaging
- Progress indicators – show completion status of multi-step prerequisites
- Contextual help – explain why prerequisites matter and how to satisfy them
- Disabled states – communicate unavailable actions and their requirements

### Encouragement & nudges

Gentle influence towards beneficial actions without removing actor agency. The system suggests, recommends, or highlights opportunities while preserving choice. This category balances guidance with autonomy, using psychological principles to support decision-making without manipulation.

##### Transitions
Successful encouragement leads to instruction-seeking or direct action; ignored nudges may cycle back to different encouragement approaches.

##### Related patterns
- [Suggestion](../?path=/docs/patterns-suggestion--docs) – contextual recommendations based on behavior patterns
- Default selections – pre-populate optimal choices while allowing changes
- Social proof – show what similar actors have chosen
- Tooltips and hints – provide just-in-time guidance
- Gamification elements – progress badges, streaks, achievements
- Smart notifications – timing-aware prompts that respect actor attention

### Instructions for action

Clear, actionable guidance that enables confident task completion. The system provides specific steps, visual cues, and feedback to help actors understand not just what to do, but how to do it successfully. Instructions adapt to actor skill level and context, reducing cognitive load while maintaining precision.

##### Transitions
Good instructions lead directly to successful action completion; unclear instructions may force actors back into navigation or encouragement phases.

##### Related patterns
- Progressive disclosure – reveal complexity gradually as needed
- Indication – visual cues showing interactive elements and their purposes
- Onboarding flows – structured introduction to new capabilities
- Inline help – contextual guidance embedded in the interface
- Error prevention – constraints and formatting that guide correct input
- Keyboard shortcuts – efficient alternatives for skilled actors

### Consequences of action

Communicating the immediate and long-term results of actor decisions. The system provides clear feedback about what happened, what changed, and what options are now available. This builds mental models of cause and effect, enabling actors to make better decisions and recover from mistakes.

##### Transitions
Clear consequences enable continued action flows; unclear results may trigger re-finding or exploration behaviors.

##### Related patterns
- Success states – confirmation that actions completed successfully
- Error messages – specific, actionable feedback when things go wrong
- System status – real-time updates on processing and changes
- Undo/redo – reversible actions that reduce decision anxiety
- Audit trails – historical record of actions and their effects
- Notifications – asynchronous updates about action outcomes

### Commitment level

Matching interface friction to the significance of actor decisions. Low-commitment actions should be effortless and reversible, while high-commitment actions require deliberate confirmation. This prevents both accidental damage and unnecessary obstacles, creating appropriate psychological weight for different types of choices.

##### Transitions
Proper commitment calibration enables confident action-taking; mismatched commitment levels create either recklessness or paralysis.

##### Related patterns
- Undo/redo – reversible actions that reduce commitment anxiety
- Confirmation dialogues – explicit verification for destructive or costly actions
- Low-commitment indicators – subtle styling for exploratory or reversible actions
- High-commitment indicators – prominent styling for significant decisions
- Destructive action patterns – visual and interaction design for dangerous operations
- Batch operations – group low-commitment actions to reduce individual decision weight

## Interaction as conversational alignment

[Conversation](../?path=/docs/foundations-conversation--docs) as a paradigm implies interaction qualities—turn-based flow, and cooperation. Designing from a conversational point of view therefore grounds interaction as a shared, adaptive process where meaning is negotiated and trust is built turn by turn.

### Turn-taking in behaviour transitions

The seek–use–share framework naturally creates conversational turns: actors seek (ask), systems respond (provide), actors evaluate (acknowledge), and systems adapt (adjust). This turn-taking rhythm appears across behaviour modes:

- **Motivated movement**: actor (A) queries → system (S) responds → A navigates → S provides feedback
- **Delightful discovery**: S suggests → A explores → S reveals → A discovers
- **Foggy finding**: A hunts → S offers clues → A refines → S clarifies

### Cooperative design principles

Following conversational [cooperation maxims](../?path=/docs/foundations-conversation--docs#cooperation), interaction design should:

- **Quantity**: Provide appropriate information density for each behaviour mode
- **Quality**: Ensure system responses match actor intent and capability
- **Relation**: Maintain contextual relevance across behaviour transitions
- **Manner**: Use clear, accessible interaction patterns
- **Politeness**: Respect actor agency and cognitive boundaries

This conversational foundation ensures that behaviour transitions feel natural and cooperative rather than adversarial or confusing.

### Multi-actor extension

These individual interaction principles extend to multi-actor scenarios. See [Collaboration](../?path=/docs/patterns-collaboration--docs) for patterns addressing coordination between multiple actors, including specific Human↔AI interaction modes that build upon these behavioral foundations.
