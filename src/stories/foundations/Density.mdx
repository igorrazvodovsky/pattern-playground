# Density

The amount of information an interface can provide over a series of moments.

{/*
Separating density into dimensions gives you better control. You can intentionally dial up
visual density without overwhelming users by keeping information density balanced
or lowering temporal density.

## Visual density

- How many things you see in a given space.
- A question of visual perception and consequently a result of color + sizing + spacing + typography.
- It's mostly addressed by [spacing](../?path=/docs/foundations-spacing--docs) increment and its levels.

## Information density

- How much meaningful content is communicated per unit of visual space.
- It's not just about how much you cram in visually, but about how much meaningful information the user gains.
- High information density might mean richly informative dashboards, detailed maps, or complex diagrams.
- Low information density tends toward simplicity, clarity, and minimalism, sacrificing detail for immediate comprehension.

## Design density

- The complexity and layering of design decisions, components, and interactions within the UI.
- High design density includes multiple interacting components, states, patterns, modals, nested interactions, or deeply layered navigation structures.
- Low design density emphasizes simplicityâ€”fewer states, fewer types of interactions, more straightforward flow.

## Temporal density

Just like having more stuff packed into a space creates visual density, having more actions packed into a period creates temporal density.
