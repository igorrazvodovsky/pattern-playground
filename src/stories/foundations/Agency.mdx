# Agency

The ability to act independently, make decisions, and execute tasks with lesser need for human control/involvement/interaction.
Agency is a combination of three components:
- Autonomy
- Adaptivity
- Interactivity

# Agency & design system levels

- Agency have a direct relatioship to user need.
- The more is known about the user's needs, the easier it is for the different parts of the app to be proactive.

# Adaptivity

### Foundations & primitives

At the smallest scale, we have the content on a page: text, images, icons, and styles. These are each made up of hard-coded letters, numbers, svgs, pixels, etc, that an LLM arrange to generate new content on the fly. This level is the most flexible, allowing for a huge range of expression. Imagine: ChatGPT generating new text to respond to a user's message.

### Components

Components can be pulled in where appropriate to help the user interact with the page. Imagine: a generated menu with relevant actions based on what the user is doing.

### Compositions and patterns

These carry more structure and meaning, building on users' goals and needs. These blocks can be pulled in where needed, building whole sections at once.
