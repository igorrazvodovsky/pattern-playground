# Agency

The distribution of decision-making and control between system and user within an interface.

## Actors

- *System agency* is the ability of a system to act independently, make decisions, and execute tasks on behalf of the user.
- *User agency* is the user's ability to maintain control, override system decisions, understand system behaviour, and retain their expertise and judgement.

## Components

 - Autonomy,
 - [Adaptation](../?path=/docs/foundations-adaptation--docs)
 - Interactivity

## Spectrum

System agency can be thought of as operating on a continuum from high autonomy through to only reacting to user input:

**User-driven** â†’ **Assistance** â†’ **Automation** â†’ **Autonomy**

- **User-driven**: System responds only to explicit user commands
- **Assistance**: System provides contextual help and suggestions
- **Automation**: System executes predefined workflows with minimal user input
- **Autonomy**: System makes independent decisions and adapts behaviour dynamically

As system agency increases, preserving user agency becomes more critical to maintain user control and prevent skill atrophy.

## Relationships to different levels of design system

System agency progressively expands as we move up through scales of the design system:

### [Foundation](../?path=/docs/foundations-overview--docs)

At the  level, basic elements provide limited to no agency.
They're tightly constrained, predictable, and dependableâ€”ensuring everything stays
visually and contextually coherent.

### [Primitives](../?path=/docs/primitives-overview--docs) and [components](../?path=/docs/components-overview--docs)

Assistanceâ€”like setting a default valueâ€”is probably the most typical example of agency on this level.
Primitives can also be dynamically arranged, selected, or surfaced based on context.
A [toolbar](../?path=/docs/components-toolbar--docs) might offer precisely relevant actions in response to user intent,
actively supporting the user's immediate goals without straying too far from familiar interactions.

### [Compositions](../?path=/docs/compositions-overview--docs)
[Messages](../?path=/docs/compositions-messaging--docs) or product [cards](../?path=/docs/compositions-card--docs)â€”can carry greater agency.
They intelligently package sets of components into meaningful units. With increased agency, compositions can adapt themselves dynamically,
appearing precisely where and when users need them, leveraging context.

### [Patterns](../?path=/docs/patterns-overview--docs)
Patterns can adapt and reshape themselves strategically to construct the flow of
an interface and to actively guide the user. [Explanations](../?path=/docs/patterns-explanation--docs), [suggestions](../?path=/docs/patterns-suggestion--docs), or [dynamically
arranged sections](../?path=/docs/patterns-focus-and-context--docs) respond proactively, anticipating user needs and creating experiences that feel
coherent, intentional, and responsive.

## Balancing system and user agency

- **Mental model shift**: Designing agentive software requires viewing software as an active participant rather than passive tool.
- **Delegation vs control**: Strike a balance between leveraging system capabilities and maintaining user oversight. Users should retain the ability to review, modify, and make final decisions.
- **Preserving expertise**: Protect user domain knowledge by ensuring meaningful engagement with tasks. Complete delegation can lead to skill atrophy and loss of critical judgement.
- **Transparency**: System decisions should be explainable and understandable to maintain user trust and enable informed intervention.
- **Graceful degradation**: When system agency fails, users should be able to seamlessly take control without losing context or progress.
