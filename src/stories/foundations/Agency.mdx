# Agency

The ability of a system to act independently, make decisions, and execute tasks.

## Components

 - Autonomy,
 - [Adaptation](../?path=/docs/foundations-adaptation--docs)
 - Interactivity

## Spectrum

Agency can be thought of as operating on a continuum from a high level of agency through to the point of only reacting to user input (same goes for its components).

## Relationships to different levels of design system

Agency progressively expands as we move up through scales of the design system:

### [Foundation](../?path=/docs/foundations-overview--docs)

At the  level, basic elements provide limited to no agency.
They're tightly constrained, predictable, and dependableâ€”ensuring everything stays
visually and contextually coherent.

### [Primitives](../?path=/docs/primitives-overview--docs) and [components](../?path=/docs/components-overview--docs)

Assistanceâ€”like setting a default valueâ€”is probably the most typical example of agency on this level.
Primitives can also be dynamically arranged, selected, or surfaced based on context.
A [toolbar](../?path=/docs/components-toolbar--docs) might offer precisely relevant actions in response to user intent,
actively supporting the user's immediate goals without straying too far from familiar interactions.

### [Compositions](../?path=/docs/compositions-overview--docs)
[Comment threads](../?path=/docs/compositions-comment-thread--docs) or product [cards](../?path=/docs/compositions-card--docs)â€”can carry greater agency.
They intelligently package sets of components into meaningful units. With increased agency,
compositions can adapt themselves dynamically, appearing precisely where and when users need them,
leveraging context.

### [Patterns](../?path=/docs/patterns-overview--docs)
Patterns can adapt and reshape themselves strategically to construct the flow of
an interface and to actively guide the user. [Explanations](../?path=/docs/patterns-explanation--docs), [suggestions](../?path=/docs/patterns-suggestion--docs), or [dynamically
arranged sections](../?path=/docs/patterns-intent-based-adaptation--docs) respond proactively, anticipating user needs and creating experiences that feel
coherent, intentional, and responsive.

## Things to consider

- Designing agentive software requires a change in the mental model: from viewing software as a passive tool to active participant.
- Design must strike a balance between delegating tasks to the system and maintaining user control and judgement. Interfaces and interactions should leverage the AI's capabilities while ensuring humans can review, modify, and ultimately make final decisions.
- This includes protecting and advancing user expertise when valuable. If 100% of tasks are delegated to AI, a user will start forgetting domain knowledge.
