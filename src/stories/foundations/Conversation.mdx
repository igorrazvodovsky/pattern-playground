# Conversation

Every interaction is built as a move in an ongoing conversation between actors who are trying to coordinate action.
Recognise that clicking a button is not just triggering a functionâ€”it is making a request, offering a promise, or declaring something complete.
Make these conversational acts visible and traceable. Design patterns that understand their role in human coordination, not just their visual presentation.

When someone assigns a task, they are making a request that can be accepted, declined, or negotiated. When someone marks something complete,
they are making a declaration that others may need to acknowledge. When someone fills out a form, they are making promises about the accuracy of that information.

## Cooperation
To function, conversation must be cooperative. Grice's conversational maxims (extended with "politeness" by Lakoff) provide a foundation for this cooperation:
- Quantity â€“ providing just enough information to be helpful.
- Quality â€“ offering contributions that are accurate and grounded.
- Relation â€“ staying relevant and appropriate to the context, intent, or thread.
- Manner â€“ communicating clearly and accessibly; avoid ambiguity.
- Politeness â€“ being respectful of agency, boundaries, and tone.

## General conversational patterns
Supporting rhythm, repair, and rapport in interactions:
- Turn-taking & pacing
- Providing Information
- Clarification
- Error handling & recovery
- Feedback & confirmation
- Related patterns
