# Conversation

The dynamic exchange through which actors surface goals, negotiate means, verify shared understanding, and tune complexity through shared vocabulary and protocols.

Every interaction is a move in this ongoing conversation—actors coordinate action turn by turn. Clicking a button isn't just triggering a function; it's making a request, offering a promise, or declaring completion. These conversational acts should be visible and traceable, so design patterns should understand their role in human coordination, not just their visual presentation.

## The conversational loop

Every interaction follows a conversational pattern: request, reception, processing, and response. The human issues commands or inputs, the software receives and processes them, then responds. This constant back-and-forth requires continuous feedback—confirmation that inputs are being processed, that things are working normally, and that progress continues toward the intended goal.

The interface mediates this exchange. Software can't yet match human spontaneity, but it can mimic a conversation partner by being understandable, indicating when it's listening, and making responses obvious. Good interfaces anticipate next steps and offer recommendations, much as a considerate person would help their conversation partner.

## Cooperation
To function, conversation must be cooperative. Grice's conversational maxims (extended with "politeness" by Lakoff) provide a foundation for this cooperation:
- Quantity – providing just enough information to be helpful.
- Quality – offering contributions that are accurate and grounded.
- Relation – staying relevant and appropriate to the context, intent, or thread.
- Manner – communicating clearly and accessibly; avoid ambiguity.
- Politeness – being respectful of agency, boundaries, and tone.

## Conversational patterns
Supporting rhythm, repair, and rapport in interactions:
- Turn-taking & pacing – managing the exchange between human and software.
- Providing information – offering context and guidance at the right moments.
- Clarification – resolving ambiguity before proceeding.
- Error handling & recovery – graceful failure and repair mechanisms.
- Feedback & confirmation – continuous signals that the system is listening and responding.
- Anticipation & recommendation – suggesting next steps to move the conversation forward.

Without conversation, you have mere communication—data transmission that moves information but not understanding, agreement, or commitments. Goals remain implicit, misalignment grows, and complexity overwhelms the partnership.
