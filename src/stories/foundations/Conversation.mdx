# Conversation

The dynamic exchange through which actors surface goals, negotiate means, verify shared understanding, and tune complexity through shared vocabulary and protocols.

Every interaction is a move in this ongoing conversationâ€”actors coordinate action turn by turn. Clicking a button isn't just triggering a function; it's making a request, offering a promise, or declaring completion. These conversational acts should be visible and traceable, so design patterns that understand their role in human coordination, not just their visual presentation.

{/* When someone assigns a task, they are making a request that can be accepted, declined, or negotiated. When someone marks something complete, they are declaring completion that others may need to acknowledge. When someone fills out a form, they are making promises about the accuracy of that information. */}

## Cooperation
To function, conversation must be cooperative. Grice's conversational maxims (extended with "politeness" by Lakoff) provide a foundation for this cooperation:
- Quantity â€“ providing just enough information to be helpful.
- Quality â€“ offering contributions that are accurate and grounded.
- Relation â€“ staying relevant and appropriate to the context, intent, or thread.
- Manner â€“ communicating clearly and accessibly; avoid ambiguity.
- Politeness â€“ being respectful of agency, boundaries, and tone.

## General conversational patterns
Supporting rhythm, repair, and rapport in interactions:
- Turn-taking & pacing
- Providing Information
- Clarification
- Error handling & recovery
- Feedback & confirmation
- Related patterns

- Enables [collaboration](../?path=/docs/foundations-collaboration--docs). Without conversation, you have mere communicationâ€”data transmission that moves information but not understanding, agreement, or commitments. Goals remain implicit, misalignment grows, and complexity overwhelms the partnership.
