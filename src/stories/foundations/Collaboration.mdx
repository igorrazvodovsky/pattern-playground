# Collaboration

The distribution of work and decision-making across multiple actors who jointly pursue shared goals through mutual influence and negotiated coordination.

Collaboration requires distributed [agency](../?path=/docs/foundations-agency--docs) and reciprocal [adaptation](../?path=/docs/foundations-adaptation--docs).
Actors continuously align their understanding of goals and coordinate their means.

Effective collaboration depends on [conversation](../?path=/docs/foundations-conversation--docs) to shared understanding and enable actors to surface goals, verify comprehension, and tune complexity through agreed protocols.
Without this conversational foundation, systems may achieve *communication* (data transfer) but not *collaboration* (coordinated partnership).

## Core tensions

Effective collaboration must balance competing forces:

- *Visibility vs noise*: participants need awareness of others' activities without being overwhelmed
- *Flexibility vs consistency*: individuals need autonomy to experiment while maintaining coherent group outcomes
- *Individual agency vs group alignment*: actors want ownership of their contributions while converging on shared results

Managing these tensions requires deliberate design of conversational protocols, [agency](../?path=/docs/foundations-agency--docs) distribution, and variety management.

{/* ## Variety management */}
{/* Following Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety, effective collaboration requires: */}
{/* - *Amplifying variety* when diverse perspectives and approaches add value */}
{/* - *Attenuating variety* when coordination costs exceed benefits */}
{/* Conversation provides the mechanism for this tuningâ€”through shared vocabulary, agreed protocols, and explicit negotiation of what requires alignment vs what permits divergence. */}
