# Collaboration

The distribution of work and decision-making across multiple actors who jointly pursue shared goals through mutual influence and negotiated coordination.

Collaboration requires distributed [agency](../?path=/docs/qualities-agency--docs) and reciprocal [adaptability](../?path=/docs/qualities-adaptability--docs).
Actors continuously align their understanding of goals and coordinate their means.

Effective collaboration depends on [conversation](../?path=/docs/qualities-conversation--docs) to build shared understanding and enable actors to surface goals, verify comprehension, and tune complexity through agreed protocols.

Quality collaboration often follows a hybrid rhythm: individuals ideate privately, then groups filter and synthesise, iterating between these modes multiple times.
This alternation preserves the benefits of solo thinking while leveraging collective intelligence for refinement.

## Core tensions

Effective collaboration must balance competing forces:

- Visibility vs noise: participants need awareness of others' activities without being overwhelmed, including clarity about audience—who can see shared content
- Flexibility vs consistency: individuals need autonomy to experiment while maintaining coherent group outcomes
- Individual agency vs group alignment: actors want ownership of their contributions while converging on shared results
- Fidelity vs exploration: low-fidelity spaces invite collaborative ideation; high-fidelity tools enforce structure that inhibits exploratory markup
- Permanence vs ephemerality: balancing durable intellectual corpus building with temporary workgroup spaces
- Synchronicity: choosing between real-time simultaneous work and asynchronous threaded collaboration

Managing these tensions requires deliberate design of conversational protocols and [agency](../?path=/docs/qualities-agency--docs) distribution.

## Collaboration modes

Collaborative work manifests across four distinct archetypes, each serving different needs:

- Private sanctuary — individual ideation space where actors develop ideas without group influence, supports diversity of thought
- Lightweight broadcasting — selective sharing of sketches or early ideas with chosen colleagues for feedback without full group coordination
- Ad hoc workgroups — temporary cross-functional teams assembled for specific problems, often spanning organisational boundaries
- Durable teams — persistent collaborative spaces where groups build shared intellectual corpus over time

Effective collaboration systems support fluid movement between these modes rather than forcing a single interaction pattern.

## Collective intelligence

The emergent ability of groups, whether composed of humans, or networks of humans and [bots](../?path=/docs/patterns-bot--docs), to solve problems, make decisions, or generate knowledge more effectively than individual actors alone.
Conditions for this emergence include:

- Diversity: Broad participation increases the information base and reduces blind spots. Design should invite perspectives from different roles, backgrounds, and expertise levels rather than defaulting to homogeneous input.
- Independence: Contributions made without correlated influence avoid groupthink and preserve signal diversity. When actors see others' contributions before forming their own views, anchoring effects reduce collective accuracy.
- Aggregation: Principled mechanisms synthesise many inputs into collective outputs. Without aggregation, diverse independent contributions remain fragmented. {/* Voting, rating, weighted synthesis, and editorial curation are all aggregation mechanisms with different properties. */}
- Holopticism: Shared visibility of contributions and evolving state enables participants to see how their input relates to the whole.

> *Independence* and *holopticism* create tension: full visibility can undermine independence through social influence, yet without visibility actors can't calibrate their contributions to group needs. Effective CI design sequences these—independence during contribution, holopticism during synthesis.

{/* Design choices that support one CI condition may undermine another. Showing others' annotations (holopticism) can anchor subsequent annotators (reducing independence). The hybrid rhythm—solo ideation → group synthesis—manages this by sequencing conditions appropriately. */}

### Parallel vs serial aggregation

Serial aggregation introduces noise: early contributions disproportionately influence later ones. Where possible, collect contributions in parallel before revealing aggregate state.

### CI across interaction stages

CI conditions map to [collaboration stages](../?path=/docs/patterns-collaboration--docs#interaction-stages):

- *Perceive/Think*: independence matters most—blind contribution phases prevent anchoring
- *Express*: diversity surfaces through varied articulation modes and formats
- *Collaborate*: holopticism enables calibration; turn-taking supports equal contribution
- *Test*: aggregation synthesises evaluation into collective judgment
