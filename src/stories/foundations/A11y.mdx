# Accessibility

I'm trying my best 🫤 True accessibility means continuously learning,
adapting, and striving to create inclusive experiences for as many people as possible.
What works for one user might be completely unusable for another.

## Current state in practical terms

- Some foreground colours are calculated based on background colour to ensure the necessary contrast.
- Keyboard navigation should be supported for all interactive elements.

## Todo

- Find a way to make it integral part of the design process
  - Checklists 🤔
  - Automated testing
- AX: 🤖 agents as _disabled_ users?
- Test more with assistive technologies
- More nuansed colour calculation.
