> 🤯 **Fun meter: 5/5**. Exploring how AI-powered software operates on layered data architectures where deterministic foundations are augmented with probabilistic layers.

# Data & Information

Data and information exist in layers of varying certainty and permanence, from deterministic source-of-truth records to contextual AI-generated inferences that users can configure based on their needs.

## Two-dimensional framework

Data can be categorized along two independent dimensions that determine trustworthiness and appropriate treatment:

### Certainty

#### Deterministic
- Same input always produces same output
- No probability or confidence scores needed
- Fully explainable through rules or computation
- Examples: RDF inferences, aggregations, rule-based derivations

#### Probabilistic
- Same input may produce different outputs
- Confidence scores communicate uncertainty
- Explanations are approximations
- Examples: AI pattern detection, ML predictions, semantic similarity

### Provenance

#### Explicit
- Created directly by users or source systems
- Manually entered or imported
- Examples: Form submissions, uploaded files, user selections

#### Derived
- Computed from explicit data using rules or logic
- Deterministic transformations
- Examples: Calculated totals, RDF inferences, taxonomy classifications

#### Inferred
- Discovered through pattern analysis
- Typically probabilistic
- Examples: Semantic similarity, AI-detected relationships, clustering

#### Deduced
- Suggested possibilities not yet confirmed
- Speculative, lowest certainty
- Examples: AI recommendations, predicted missing data, suggested next steps

## Layered data architecture

1. Foundation: Explicit deterministic data—user input, source records, canonical relationships
2. Computed: Derived deterministic data—aggregations, rule-based inferences, RDF reasoning
3. Inferenced: Inferred probabilistic data—AI-discovered patterns, semantic connections, learned models
4. Speculation layer: Deduced probabilistic data—AI suggestions, domain knowledge applications, predicted needs

## Configurability principle

Different users and contexts benefit from different ratios of hard to soft data.
The design may support adjustable layering:

- Intensity: How much soft data to show. Minimal (hard data only) → Moderate → Maximum (all inferences)
- Specificity: Which domain knowledge to use. Generic patterns → Domain-specific → User-provided
- Interactivity: How soft data behaves. Passive (view only) → Suggestive (accept/reject) → Active
