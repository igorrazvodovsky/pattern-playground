# Color

The goal is to find a good enough tradeoff between simplicity, the needs of different components, and potential branding requirements.
The focus is on functional needs: color that supports guiding users, draws attention to important information, and makes content more accessible.

{/* TODO: Color and dev. experience */}

## Approach

- Colors are defined using OKLCH color space.
- All palettes use the same scale for relative saturation and lightness.
- Palettes (neutral, primary, info, warning, etc.) are defined by their hues.
- The lightness of the color corresponds to its use.
- Chroma for each lightness level are picked to ensure maximum visual consistency between palettes.
- Foreground colors are calculated based on background color to ensure the necessary contrast.
