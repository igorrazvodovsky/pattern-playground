> ðŸ™‚ **Fun meter: interesting**. My first attempt at building a system without THE grid.

# Layout

The layout system determines how an app organizes its elements, establishing visual hierarchies that guide users' attention.

# Spacing

- The spacing is structured around a base unit for each density level. It determines the scale used across components.
- T-shirt sizes are used to make differences between levels easier to understand.
- A scale for each [density](../?path=/docs/foundations-density--docs) level is created using the ```base unit``` and ```space increment``` values.

{/* ## Generating the scale */}

# Grid

Instead of top-down grid system bottom-up approach is used. That is container queries are used to manage each componentâ€™s layout.
Additionally, three default utilities are used for common layout solutions. Compositions and patterns either use ready-to-wear solutions
or have context-specific custom layouts and grid solutions.
