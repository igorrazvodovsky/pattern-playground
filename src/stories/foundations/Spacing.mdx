# Spacing

- The spacing is structured around a base unit for each density level. It determines the scale used across components.
- T-shirt sizes are used to make differences between levels easier to understand.
- A scale for each [density](../?path=/docs/foundations-density--docs) level is created using the ```base unit``` and ```space increment``` values.

{/* ## Generating the scale */}
