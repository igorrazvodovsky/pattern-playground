# Temporality

Time is a fundamental dimension of human experience. It is the medium through which relationships are built, trust is established, and agency is negotiated.

## Rhythm
The beat-by-beat flow of interaction. This is where [conversation](../?path=/docs/foundations-conversation--docs) happens.
- Turn-taking: The gap between user action and system response.
- Pacing: Is the interaction fast and efficient (e.g. using [command menu](../?path=/docs/patterns-command-menu--docs)) or slow and reflective (e.g. in a [wizard](../?path=/docs/patterns-wizard--docs) or when adding [annotations](../?path=/docs/patterns-annotation--docs))?
- Latency: Both technical latency and intentional delay used to communicate "thinking", "effort", or to prevent overwhelming the user.

## Lifecycle
The evolution of the user's relationship with the system over days, weeks, or months.

- [*Orientation*](../?path=/docs/patterns-onboarding--docs): Initial learning and discovery
- *Incorporation*: Efficiency and integration—shortcuts, reduced density, staying out of the way
- *Identification*: Expression and connection—customisation, personalisation

## History
How the system handles the past, present, and future.
- *Past:* logs, [undo](../?path=/docs/patterns-undo--docs), version history. The ability to "rewind" time. [Annotations](../?path=/docs/patterns-annotation--docs) also serve as "wear"—visible traces of past attention.
- *Present:* The current state and focus.
- *Future:* Anticipation, prediction, and suggestion. Drafts, previews, and "what-if" spaces let people explore possible futures before committing—supporting play, learning, and confident decision-making.

## Synchronicity
The temporal mode of interaction and collaboration.
- *Synchronous:* Real-time, simultaneous interaction requiring immediate response
- *Asynchronous:* Deferred interaction allowing considered responses across time
- Different tasks and collaboration modes require different temporal rhythms (see [Collaboration](../?path=/docs/foundations-collaboration--docs))

## Duration
How the system communicates time passing and progress.
- *Progress:* Showing advancement through tasks or processes
- *Loading:* Managing expectations during system operations
- *Persistence:* When and how changes are saved
