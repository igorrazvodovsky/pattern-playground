# Shareability

The extent to which system state can be captured, transmitted, and reliably reconstructed through links, enabling users to communicate precise application contexts to others.

## Principle

A shareable link preserves the complete user experience—returning any user to the same view, configuration, and content. This honours the fundamental web architecture where URLs serve as both addresses and state descriptors, ensuring that refreshing, bookmarking, or sharing a link maintains context rather than losing it.

Shareability transforms applications from ephemeral, session-bound experiences into persistent, communicable states. When users can share exactly what they see, interfaces become more transparent, collaborative, and trustworthy.

## URL as state container

URLs provide native, universal state management through three mechanisms:

### Path segments

Hierarchical navigation and resource identification:
```
/projects/42/tasks/18
/users/alice/settings
```

Best for: entity relationships, navigational structure, semantic hierarchy.

### Query parameters

Configuration, filters, and non-hierarchical state:
```
?view=grid&sort=date&status=active&page=3
?theme=dark&density=comfortable
```

Best for: view preferences, filters, sorting, pagination, search queries, feature flags.

### Fragments

Client-side navigation, scroll positions, and element targeting:
```
#section-3
#L42-L58
#canvas-x=1240&y=680&zoom=2.5
```

Best for: in-page positions, highlighted ranges, canvas coordinates, selected elements.

## What to share

### Appropriate candidates

State that enhances collaboration, reference, and reproducibility:
- Search and filters — preserve query context for shared discovery
- View configuration — layout mode (grid/list), density, grouping
- Sort and pagination — maintain position within large datasets
- Feature toggles — experimental or accessibility settings
- Canvas state — zoom, pan, selected elements (design tools, maps)
- Highlighting and selection — specific content ranges or annotations

### Poor candidates

State that compromises security, performance, or user experience:
- Sensitive data — passwords, tokens, personal identifiers
- Temporary UI states — modal visibility, dropdown expansion, hover states
- Unsaved input — draft content, incomplete forms
- High-frequency transient data — mouse position, animation frames
- Session-specific state — authentication status, temporary permissions

## Related patterns

### Agency
Shareability strengthens [user agency](../?path=/docs/foundations-agency--docs) by making system state explicit and controllable. Users can precisely communicate their view, bookmark moments for later, and verify that "what they see is what they share." URLs become user-accessible state inspectors rather than opaque technical addresses.

### Conversation
URLs function as [conversational interfaces](../?path=/docs/foundations-conversation--docs)—they're contracts between application and user that communicate intent clearly. A well-designed URL answers "what am I looking at?" just by being read. This transparency builds trust and supports cooperative interaction.

### Adaptation
[Adaptive systems](../?path=/docs/foundations-adaptation--docs) benefit from URL state as a mechanism for user-driven personalisation. View preferences, feature toggles, and configuration encoded in URLs let users experiment with adaptations and share successful configurations with others.

### Accessibility
Shareable URLs improve [accessibility](../?path=/docs/foundations-a11y--docs) by enabling users to bookmark and return to specific configurations (high contrast, increased density, focus modes). State persistence through URLs ensures assistive preferences aren't lost between sessions.

{/* ### Collaborative patterns */}
{/* - Share link generators — create shortened or formatted share links */}
{/* - Link previews — show what state a shared link will restore */}
{/* - Deep linking — direct access to specific content or configurations */}

{/* ### Progressive enhancement */}
{/* - Client-side routing — URLs work with and without JavaScript */}
{/* - Server-side rendering — URLs produce meaningful responses server-side */}
{/* - Bookmarkability — every significant state has a unique, stable URL */}
