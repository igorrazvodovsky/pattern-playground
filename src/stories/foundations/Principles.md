## Complexity & redundancy

- there are many different ways that a process can happen
- **there is a fuzziness to the system** â€“ different combinations of interactions can have the same result, and a particular combination can have different outcomes depending on the context.

## Modularity

Modularity is an efficient way to build, since it relies on components that have already been tried and tested and permits the modification or replacement of one part more or less independently from the others.

## Multilevel, multidirectional, and hierarchical organisation

- You will never find all the explanations at a single level of magnification
- What is more, each level in the hierarchy of system's organisation has its own rules, which are not sensitive to the fine details of those below.
- At the same time, influences can propagate through these levels in both directions
