## Embracing complexity

- Design for systems where multiple configurations or interaction pathways can lead to similar outcomes.
- **There is a fuzziness to the system** â€“ different combinations of interactions can have the same result, and a particular combination can have different outcomes depending on the context.
- Multiple UI patterns can solve the same user need - a modal, drawer, or dialog all provide
focused interaction, but users may prefer different approaches based on context.

## Modularity

Modularity is the lever against complexity. Modularity enables efficient building through reusable components that can be modified or replaced independently.

Rather than prescribing one "correct" way to accomplish tasks, the modular approach lets users:
- Navigate through different interaction pathways
- Combine patterns to match their workflow
- Adapt interfaces to their specific needs and contexts

## Multilevel, multidirectional, and hierarchical organisation

- You will never find all the explanations at a single level of magnification
- What is more, each level in the hierarchy of system's organisation has its own rules, which are not sensitive to the fine details of those below.
- At the same time, influences can propagate through these levels in both directions

## Combinatorial logic

Design patterns that can be combined in multiple ways to create complex behaviours. The power of the system should come from the interactions between patterns, not from individual complex entities.
