      "plainText": "Climate change is reshaping ecosystems at a pace that many species can't keep up with. As temperatures rise, animals and plants are being pushed out of their natural habitats. Species adapted to cold environments—like polar bears, snow leopards, and certain alpine plants—are seeing their habitats shrink or disappear entirely. Some animals are migrating to higher altitudes or latitudes, but these shifts aren't always possible or fast enough, especially for species with limited mobility or specialised diets.\n\nChanges in temperature and precipitation are also throwing off the rhythms of nature. Many species rely on environmental cues for breeding, migration, and feeding. When spring arrives earlier, some birds migrate before their food sources are abundant. If insects hatch too early or too late for birds to feed their chicks, or if flowers bloom before pollinators are active, the entire chain can fall apart. These mismatches can ripple through ecosystems, weakening the interdependence that many species rely on to survive.\n\nWarming oceans are particularly devastating. Coral reefs, which are biodiversity hotspots, are bleaching and dying due to heat stress. Marine animals that depend on these reefs for food and shelter are left vulnerable. Ocean acidification, another by-product of increased CO₂ levels, is making it harder for shellfish and corals to build their skeletons. The decline of keystone species can cause cascading effects, altering food webs and leading to further biodiversity loss. In short, climate change is a force multiplier for stressors already facing wildlife, accelerating extinction rates and making conservation efforts more urgent and complex.",

Regular measurement enables organisations to identify reduction opportunities and track progress toward net-zero goals.\n\nResource utilisation metrics provide insights into efficiency and waste reduction. Water consumption, material usage rates, and waste generation patterns reveal opportunities for circular economy implementation. Energy intensity measurements help optimise operations and transition to renewable sources.\n\nBiodiversity impact assessments are becoming increasingly important.
