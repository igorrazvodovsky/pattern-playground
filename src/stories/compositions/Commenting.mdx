# Commenting

Enables contextual discussion and annotation across any interface or content type.
Commenting creates a layer of social interaction that can be applied to any object, supporting collaborative review and knowledge sharing without disrupting the primary experience.

## Variants

{/* ### Attachment modes */}
{/* Floating: Comments appear as overlays or callouts */}
{/* Sidebar: Comments collect in a dedicated panel */}

{/* ### Threading models */}
- Flat: Simple comment lists without nesting
- Threaded: Nested replies supporting conversation depth

### Resolution states
Persistent: Comments remain visible until manually resolved
- Supports ongoing discussions and reference
- Useful for documentation and knowledge capture
- Maintains historical context

Ephemeral: Comments fade over time
- Reduces interface clutter for transient feedback
- Suitable for iterative design and development workflows
- Focuses attention on current issues

## States

### Empty state
- No comments exist yet
- Clear invitation to start discussions
- Might show commenting capabilities subtly

### Active commenting
- Comment threads in progress
- Clear visual indicators for commented elements
- Easy navigation between comment locations

### Resolved discussions
- Completed or archived comment threads
- Optional visibility controls for resolved items
- Historical context preservation

### Draft states
- Unsaved comment composition
- Auto-save and recovery capabilities
- Clear indication of draft vs published status

## Examples
Commenting can be integrated into any interface or content type, including:

### Text documents
<Story of={Commenting} />

### Domain entities
