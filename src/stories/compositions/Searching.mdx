# Searching

A transactional method for retrieving specific information by matching actor intent (query) with system content. Unlike [Navigating](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#navigating) (where actors move through structure) or [Browsing](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#browsing) (where actors scan for patterns), Search relies on the system to do the heavy lifting of evaluation and discrimination.

## Anatomy

The search experience spans three distinct phases, often distributed across different UI components:

### 1. Entry & query formulation
The point where the actor expresses intent.
- Keyword search: Matches exact strings or tags. Best for specific items (names, IDs).
- Natural language prompt: Describes the desired outcome or characteristics. Best for complex queries that would otherwise require heavy filtering.
- Scope:
    - Global: Searches the entire system.
    - Local: Searches only within the current context.

### 2. Processing & translation
- Lexical and statistical retrieval: explicit algorithms relying on patterns in the text.
- AI intent translation: The system bridges the gap between the actor's language and the system's taxonomy.

### 3. Results & refinement
- Instant results: Popover or dropdown.
- Search results view: A dedicated [data view](../?path=/docs/compositions-data-view--docs).

### Stability & undo
Search shouldn't destroy context. It should be easily reversible, returning the actor to their previous state (e.g., scroll position) without friction.

{/* ### Search vs. Browsing */}
{/* - **Do I know where it is?** → Navigation. */}
{/* - **Do I know what it is called?** → Search. */}
{/* - **Recall vs. recognition**: Search relies on *recall* (knowing the name), while browsing relies on *recognition*. */}
{/* - **Mental model**: Navigation teaches the structure and vocabulary of the system. Valid search requires the user to already possess this knowledge. */}
{/* ### Search vs. Filter */}
{/* - **Do I want to refine the current set?** → Filter. */}
{/* - **Do I want to find a specific item?** → Search. */}
{/* *Note: AI blurs this line. A search query can be "translated" into a set of applied filters.*

### Search vs. Prompt
- **Search**: Typically retrieval of *existing* items.
- **Prompt**: Can be retrieval, but often implies generation or execution of complex tasks.
- **Convergence**: Modern search bars are becoming "Command Bars" that accept both search queries and commands (e.g., "Create a new file"). */}

## Related patterns

### Precursors
- [Information Architecture](../?path=/docs/foundations-information-architecture--docs): The underlying structure and labeling system that search indexes. Without good IA, search is brittle.
- [Navigation / Transactional search](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#transactional-search): Defines the search as navigation *behaviour* and how it fits into the broader user movement through the system.

### Complementary
- [Filtering](../?path=/docs/compositions-filtering--docs): Often used *after* a search to refine results. In AI-search, filters are the *output* of the search query.
- [Prompt](../?path=/docs/patterns-prompt--docs): Modern search inputs are evolving into Prompt interfaces, accepting instructions alongside keywords.
- [Suggestion](../?path=/docs/patterns-suggestion--docs): Autocomplete and "Did you mean?" patterns that guide the actor during query formulation.

### Follow-ups
- [Data view](../?path=/docs/compositions-data-view--docs): The standard container for displaying search results.
- [Navigation](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-overview--docs): Often used as a fallback if search fails ("Browse by category instead").
