# Toolbar

Convenient access to frequently used commands, controls, navigation, and search that allow users to manage and manipulate a data set.

<Story of={ ToolbarStories.Toolbar } />

## Context

Options presented in the toolbar can depend on the context and state of the parent component. Things that are not applicable in the parentâ€™s state can be hidden. For example, if the parent is empty the user will have different needs compared with a full state.

## Order

Things inside toolbars are consistently ordered so that users can easily find things across different features and applications.

Features should be sorted in order of importance. Secondarily, features should be organized in logical groupings for easier recall.
