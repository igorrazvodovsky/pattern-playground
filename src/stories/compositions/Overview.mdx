# Compositions

Assembled interface configurations that enable specific user behaviours.

## Seeking & accessing

Supporting motivated movement and initial discovery. These compositions help actors find, browse, and navigate through information structures. They enable [navigating](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#navigating), [browsing](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#browsing), and [monitoring](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#monitoring) behaviors.

- [Nav bar](../?path=/docs/compositions-nav-bar--docs) - primary navigation structure for directional movement
- [Navigation models](../?path=/docs/compositions-navigation-navigation-overview--docs) - structural patterns for setting up navigation
- [Data view](../?path=/docs/compositions-data-view--docs) - structured collections supporting browsing and sweeping
- [Filtering](../?path=/docs/compositions-browsing-sensemaking-filtering--docs) - narrowing scope during exploration or transactional search
- [Searching](../?path=/docs/compositions-searching--docs)

Successful seeking narrows scope and surfaces relevant information, enabling evaluation.

## Evaluating & understanding

Supporting assessment and sense-making once relevant information is located. These compositions enable [evaluation & relevance construction](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#evaluation--relevance-construction) by presenting bounded contexts for examination and comparison.

- [Card](../?path=/docs/compositions-card-card--docs) - contained units for quick scanning and comparison
- [Item view](../?path=/docs/compositions-itemview--docs) - detailed examination of individual entities
- [Data view](../?path=/docs/compositions-data-view--docs) - comparative assessment across collections
- [Needs-based-view](../?path=/docs/compositions-needs-based-view--docs) - contextual presentation aligned with actor needs

Evaluation creates understanding, enabling informed action.

## Acting & creating

Supporting task completion and content generation. These compositions enable [application & behavioral enactment](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#application--behavioural-enactment), providing structures for input, creation, and completion with appropriate commitment levels.

- [Form](../?path=/docs/compositions-form--docs) - structured input with validation and prerequisites
- [Block-based editor](../?path=/docs/compositions-blockbasededitor-blockbasededitor--docs) - modular content assembly
- [Messaging](../?path=/docs/compositions-messaging--docs) - conversational action and dialogue

Action generates artifacts and outcomes that may need refinement or collaborative review.

## Refining & manipulating

Supporting iterative improvement and reorganization. These compositions enable actors to reshape their view of information, supporting both [sense-making & integration](../?path=/docs/foundations-interaction--docs#sense-making--integration) and continued browsing with increasing clarity.

- [Sorting](../?path=/docs/compositions-browsing-sensemaking-sorting--docs) - ordering for pattern recognition
- [Grouping](../?path=/docs/compositions-browsing-sensemaking-grouping--docs) - clustering for categorical understanding
- [Filtering](../?path=/docs/compositions-browsing-sensemaking-filtering--docs) - narrowing focus after initial exploration
- [Toolbar](../?path=/docs/compositions-menus-and-actions-toolbar--docs) - contextual actions for manipulation

Refinement enables deeper understanding, feeding back into evaluation or leading to sharing.

## Collaborating & sharing

Supporting [sharing, feedback, & iterative learning](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#sharing-feedback--iterative-learning) through multi-actor coordination. These compositions enable collective sense-making and coordination around shared artifacts.

- [Commenting](../?path=/docs/compositions-commenting--docs) - discussion and feedback on artifacts

## Behavioral transitions

Compositions often support multiple behaviors and transitions between them:

- [Data view](../?path=/docs/compositions-data-view--docs) enables browsing → navigating transitions as clarity increases
- [Filtering](../?path=/docs/compositions-browsing-sensemaking-filtering--docs) appears in both seeking (initial exploration) and refining (focused manipulation)
- [Item view](../?path=/docs/compositions-itemview--docs) can shift from evaluation → action when examination leads to decisions

{/* This flexibility reflects how real user journeys are non-linear, with compositions adapting to different behavioral contexts. */}

---

Compositions bridge [components](../?path=/docs/components-overview--docs) and [patterns](../?path=/docs/patterns-overview--docs) while embodying the behavioral framework from [Intent & Interaction](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs). A complete interface combines compositions across multiple behavioral stages, creating fluid transitions.
