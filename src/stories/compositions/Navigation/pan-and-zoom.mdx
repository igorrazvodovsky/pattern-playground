# Pan and zoom

Single large continuous spaces rather than discrete pages. Actors navigate by panning (horizontal/vertical movement) and zooming (scale changes).
Everything exists in a single coordinate system, eliminating page transitions but introducing orientation and wayfinding challenges.

## Behavioural position

**Supports**
- [Exploring](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#exploring) — spatial metaphors naturally support discovery
- [Navigating](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#navigating) — direct access to known locations (with landmarks or coordinates)
- Visual scanning and pattern recognition at multiple scales

**Constrains**
- [Re-finding](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#re-finding) — harder without clear landmarks or bookmarks
- [Transactional search](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#transactional-search) — limited unless search features can position/highlight
- Orientation — actors can get lost without good wayfinding

## Variants

- TODO: Geographic maps
- Zoomable timelines
- TODO: Infinite canvas

## States

### View states
- Overview — zoomed out, showing broad context
- Detail — zoomed in, examining specific area
- Transitioning — animating between positions/scales

### Interaction states
- Panning — actively dragging view
- Zooming — actively changing scale
- Idle — viewing without navigation
- Loading — fetching data for new visible area

### Orientation states
- Oriented — actor knows their position
- Landmarks visible — recognisable features in view
- Disoriented — requires reset or wayfinding

## Implementation patterns

- Pan controls: drag to pan, arrow keys, scrollbars, edge panning (moving cursor to edge to pan)
- Zoom controls: pinch gesture, mouse wheel, zoom buttons, double-tap/click, zoom to fit
- Orientation aids: TODO:minimap, landmarks, coordinates, reset button
- Performance optimisation: viewport culling (rendering only visible area), level of detail, tile loading, debounced updates


## Related patterns

### Complements
- [Search](../?path=/docs/compositions-search--docs) — enables jumping to locations
- [Deep linking](../?path=/docs/primitives-deep-linking--docs) — encode position and zoom in URLs for sharing
- Bookmarks or saved views
- Minimap or overview + detail patterns
- Layers or filtering for complex spaces
- [Fully Connected + Pan and Zoom](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-hybrid-patterns--docs#fully-connected--pan-and-zoom) — global nav for sections, spatial within sections

### Alternatives
- [Pyramid](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-pyramid--docs) for sequences that could be spatial
- [Fully connected](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-fully-connected--docs) + pan/zoom hybrid for maps with discrete sections
- [Multilevel tree](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-multilevel-tree--docs) for hierarchical spatial data
