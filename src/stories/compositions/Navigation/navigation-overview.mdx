# Navigation models

Structural patterns describing how screens, pages, or spaces connect to one another. These models shape which [navigation behaviours](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#navigation) actors can perform and how [agency](../?path=/docs/foundations-agency--docs) is distributed.

## Models

- [Hub and spoke](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-hub-and-spoke--docs) — central hub lists all sections, actors return to hub for cross-section navigation
- [Fully connected](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-fully-connected--docs) — every page links to all others through global navigation
- [Multilevel tree](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-multilevel-tree--docs) — hierarchical structure with global navigation for main pages, local navigation for subpages
- [Step by step](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-step-by-step--docs) — prescribed sequences with back/next controls
- [Pyramid](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-pyramid--docs) — hub lists sequence, actors can navigate sequentially or jump to any item
- [Pan and zoom](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-pan-and-zoom--docs) — continuous spatial navigation through large single spaces
- [Flat navigation](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-flat-navigation--docs) — minimal navigation, all functions accessible in one place
- [Hybrid patterns](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-hybrid-patterns--docs) — combinations of multiple models

### Refining by behaviour

- Navigate to known locations → [Fully connected](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-fully-connected--docs), [tree](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-multilevel-tree--docs)
- Browse and discover → [Pyramid](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-pyramid--docs), [pan and zoom](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-pan-and-zoom--docs)
- Complete focused tasks → [Step by step](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-step-by-step--docs), [flat](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-flat-navigation--docs)
- Monitor multiple areas → [Hub and spoke](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-hub-and-spoke--docs)

### Refining by agency

- Maximum control → [Fully connected](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-fully-connected--docs), [pan and zoom](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-pan-and-zoom--docs), [flat](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-flat-navigation--docs)
- Balanced guidance → [Pyramid](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-pyramid--docs), [tree](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-multilevel-tree--docs)
- System-guided → [Hub and spoke](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-hub-and-spoke--docs), [step by step](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-step-by-step--docs)

### Refining by scale

- Small (< 10) → [Fully connected](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-fully-connected--docs)
- Medium (10-50) → [Hub](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-hub-and-spoke--docs) (mobile), [tree](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-multilevel-tree--docs) (desktop), [pyramid](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-pyramid--docs) (sequences)
- Large (50+) → [Hybrid patterns](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-hybrid-patterns--docs)

### Hybrid combinations

When single models don't fit:

- Hub + fully connected — hub feels constraining, cross-section workflows frequent
- Tree + fully connected — large volume with clear sections, cross-section relationships
- Step by step + pyramid — logical sequence but flexible ordering, varying expertise
- Fully connected + pan and zoom — mix discrete and spatial content
- Hub + flat — multiple independent workspaces, each feature-rich
- Pyramid + tree — many sequences requiring category organisation

## Implementation considerations

### Universal navigation features

All models benefit from:
- [Deep linking](../?path=/docs/primitives-deep-linking--docs) for addressability
- [Searching](../?path=/docs/compositions-searching--docs) for direct access
- [Breadcrumbs](../?path=/docs/patterns-breadcrumbs--docs) for context
- [Command menu](../?path=/docs/patterns-command-menu--docs) for power users

### UI design independence

Models can be rendered in various ways:
- Tabs, menus, sidebar trees for *fully connected* or *tree*
- Cards, lists, grids for *hub and spoke*
- Progress indicators, stepper components, or next/previous for *step by step*
