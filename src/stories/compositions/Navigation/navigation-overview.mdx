# Navigation models

Structural patterns describing how screens, pages, or spaces connect to one another. These models shape which [navigation behaviours](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#navigation) actors can perform and how [agency](../?path=/docs/foundations-agency--docs) is distributed.

## Models

- [Hub and spoke](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-hub-and-spoke--docs) — central hub lists all sections, actors return to hub for cross-section navigation
- [Fully connected](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-fully-connected--docs) — every page links to all others through global navigation
- [Multilevel tree](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-multilevel-tree--docs) — hierarchical structure with global navigation for main pages, local navigation for subpages
- [Step by step](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-step-by-step--docs) — prescribed sequences with back/next controls
- [Pyramid](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-pyramid--docs) — hub lists sequence, actors can navigate sequentially or jump to any item
- [Pan and zoom](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-pan-and-zoom--docs) — continuous spatial navigation through large single spaces
- [Flat navigation](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-flat-navigation--docs) — minimal navigation, all functions accessible in one place
- [Hybrid patterns](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-hybrid-patterns--docs) — combinations of multiple models

## Decision tree

### By content structure

- Do you have a **single continuous space** (map, timeline, large image)?
→ [pan and zoom](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-pan-and-zoom--docs)

- Is there a **prescribed sequence actors should follow?**
Use [step by step](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-step-by-step--docs) for strict flows
or [pyramid](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-pyramid--docs) if actors should see overview and control sequencing

- Is content organised in **clear hierarchies or categories?**
Use [multilevel tree](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-multilevel-tree--docs) for structured browsing within sections
or [fully connected](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-fully-connected--docs) if hierarchy is shallow (5-7 top-level items)

- Are there **many discrete tools/functions** in one workspace?
→ [flat navigation](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-flat-navigation--docs)

- Are there **5-8 major independent sections** (especially on mobile)?
→ [hub and spoke](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-hub-and-spoke--docs)

### By behavioural priority

Actors need to **navigate precisely to known locations**
- [Fully connected](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-fully-connected--docs) or [Multilevel Tree](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-multilevel-tree--docs) (highest efficiency)
- [Pyramid](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-pyramid--docs) (good with sequence overview)
- [Hub and spoke](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-hub-and-spoke--docs) (forces hub return, less efficient)

Actors need to **browse and discover**
- [Pyramid](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-pyramid--docs) (excellent overview enables pattern recognition)
- [Pan and zoom](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-pan-and-zoom--docs) (spatial exploration)
- [Multilevel tree](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-multilevel-tree--docs) (structured browsing)

Actors need to **complete focused tasks without distraction**
- [Step by step](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-step-by-step--docs) (guided completion)
- [Flat navigation](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-flat-navigation--docs) (no navigation interruptions)

Actors need to **stay updated on multiple areas**
- [Hub and spoke](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-hub-and-spoke--docs) (hub can surface updates)

### By agency preference

**Maximum user agency** – high control, accepts complexity
- [Fully connected](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-fully-connected--docs)
- [Pan and zoom](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-pan-and-zoom--docs)
- [Flat navigation](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-flat-navigation--docs)

**Balanced** agency structure guides, doesn't constrain
- [Pyramid](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-pyramid--docs)
- [Multilevel tree](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-multilevel-tree--docs)

**System-guided** reduces cognitive load, constrains movement
- [Hub and spoke](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-hub-and-spoke--docs)
- [Step by step](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-step-by-step--docs)

### By scale

**Small** < 10 items
- [Fully connected](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-fully-connected--docs) with simple menu

**Medium** 10-50 items
- [Hub and spoke](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-hub-and-spoke--docs) for mobile
- [Multilevel tree](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-multilevel-tree--docs) for desktop
- [Pyramid](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-pyramid--docs) for sequential content

**Large** 50+ items
- [Multilevel tree](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-multilevel-tree--docs) + [Fully Connected](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-fully-connected--docs) hybrid
- Multiple [pyramids](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-pyramid--docs) with tree structure

**Very large or complex**
- [Hybrid patterns](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-hybrid-patterns--docs) combining multiple models

## Implementation considerations

### Universal navigation features

All models benefit from:
- [Deep linking](../?path=/docs/primitives-deeplinking--docs) for addressability
- [Search](../?path=/docs/compositions-search--docs) for direct access
- [Breadcrumbs](../?path=/docs/patterns-breadcrumbs--docs) for context
- [Command menu](../?path=/docs/patterns-command-menu--docs) for power users

### UI design independence

Models can be rendered in various ways:
- Tabs, menus, sidebar trees for *fully connected* or *tree*
- Cards, lists, grids for *hub and spoke*
- Progress indicators, stepper components, or next/previous for *step by step*

Choose visual treatment based on space constraints, device type, and brand requirements. Model selection precedes visual design decisions.
