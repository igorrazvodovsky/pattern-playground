# Step by step

Navigation follows a designed sequence with clear progression indicators and back/next controls. Flows range from simple two-step processes (search interface → results page) to complex multi-stage processes (questionnaires, purchase flows, onboarding), with supplementary options like skip, save and continue later, or jump to step.

## Behavioural position

This model optimises for task completion over exploration, reducing cognitive load from navigation decisions whilst constraining freedom to deviate.

Primarily supports
- [Transactional search](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#transactional-search) — optimised for getting the job done
- TODO: Goal-oriented task completion with clear endpoints

Deliberately constrains
- [Exploring](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#exploring) — intentionally limited to maintain focus
- [Browsing](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#browsing) — lateral movement discouraged or impossible
- [Navigating](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#navigating) — constrained to sequence, even when destination is known

## Variants

- Linear: strict sequence, must complete steps in order.
- Flexible: steps shown in overview, some skippable or reorderable. Approaches [pyramid model](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-pyramid--docs)
- Branching: different paths based on choices or conditions.
- Progressive disclosure sequence: simple initial steps, complexity revealed gradually.

{/* ## Validation approaches */}
{/* - **Step validation** — must complete current step to proceed */}
{/* - **Deferred validation** — gather all information, validate at end */}
{/* - **Inline validation** — real-time feedback as actor completes fields */}
