# Step by step

Navigation follows a designed sequence with clear progression indicators and back/next controls. Flows range from simple two-step processes (search interface → results page) to complex multi-stage processes (questionnaires, purchase flows, onboarding), with supplementary options like skip, save and continue later, or jump to step.

## Behavioural position

This model optimises for task completion over exploration, reducing cognitive load from navigation decisions whilst constraining freedom to deviate.

Primarily supports
- [Transactional search](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent--interaction--docs#transactional-search) — optimised for getting the job done
- TODO: Goal-oriented task completion with clear endpoints

Deliberately constrains
- [Exploring](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent--interaction--docs#exploring) — intentionally limited to maintain focus
- [Browsing](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent--interaction--docs#browsing) — lateral movement discouraged or impossible
- [Navigating](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent--interaction--docs#navigating) — constrained to sequence, even when destination is known

## Variants

- Linear: strict sequence, must complete steps in order.
- Flexible: steps shown in overview, some skippable or reorderable. Approaches [pyramid model](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-pyramid--docs)
- Branching: different paths based on choices or conditions.
- Progressive disclosure sequence: simple initial steps, complexity revealed gradually.

{/* ## Validation approaches */}
{/* - **Step validation** — must complete current step to proceed */}
{/* - **Deferred validation** — gather all information, validate at end */}
{/* - **Inline validation** — real-time feedback as actor completes fields */}

## Decision tree

### When to use

**Content structure:**
- Clear logical sequence that actors should follow
- Steps with dependencies (step 2 requires information from step 1)
- Processes with clear start and end points
- Linear workflows without branching

**Behavioural needs:**
- Task completion rate is critical
- Focus and reduced distraction are valuable
- Actors benefit from guidance
- Process must complete in sequence (payment before confirmation)

**Agency preference:**
- System-guided acceptable or desirable
- Reduced cognitive load valued over navigation freedom
- Commitment to completing the process

### When not to use

- Actors need to work non-linearly
- Process has significant branching or optional steps
- Information gathering rather than transaction (consider [pyramid](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-pyramid--docs))
- Long processes without clear milestones (creates abandonment risk)
- Actors may need to reference multiple steps simultaneously
