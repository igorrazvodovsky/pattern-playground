# Overview and detail

A navigation model where the [collection](../?path=/docs/compositions-data-view--docs) and the [item](../?path=/docs/compositions-item-view--docs) are displayed simultaneously. Selection in the overview immediately updates the detail view.
Unlike [Hub and Spoke](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-hub-and-spoke--docs), which requires navigation *between* screens, Overview-Detail maintains context by keeping the parent list visible.

## Behavioural position
- [Rapid browsing](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#browsing) — actors can scan list and verify details without back-and-forth navigation.
- [Comparison](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#evaluation--relevance-construction) — actors can quickly switch between items to compare details.

## Variants
- Split View – The list and detail are permanently locked side-by-side. Common in email clients and admin panels.
– Popover – The detail view temporarily overlays the list. This preserves the list's full width when the detail is not active but allows quick context switching.

## Related patterns
- [Hub and Spoke](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-hub-and-spoke--docs) — The sequential alternative.
- [Data view](../?path=/docs/compositions-data-view--docs) — The "Overview" component.
- [Item view](../?path=/docs/compositions-item-view--docs) — The "Detail" component.
- [Malleability](../?path=/docs/foundations-malleability--docs) — The capability to switch between topologies.
