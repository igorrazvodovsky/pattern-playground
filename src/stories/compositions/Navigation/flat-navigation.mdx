# Flat navigation

Everything is accessible in one place. Tools and functions appear via menus, toolbars, and palettes. Navigation happens within the work, not between locations.

Flat navigation replaces location-based movement with tool access. Actors know where they are (their work, document, or canvas) but must find the right tools to operate on it. The challenge shifts from "where do I go?" to "which tool do I use?"

The "flatness" isn't absolute—tools may be organised in menus or categories—but there's no navigation between content spaces. You're always "here," with all capabilities theoretically accessible.

## Behavioural position

### Supports
- [Transactional search](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#transactional-search) via [command menus](../?path=/docs/patterns-command-menu--docs) and search
- Sustained focus on work without navigation interruptions
- Tool/function discovery through organised palettes

### Challenges
- [Uncovering](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#uncovering) — finding tools vs finding content becomes the challenge
- Initial [exploring](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#exploring) is overwhelming due to feature density
- [Browsing](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#browsing) is about tools rather than content

The cognitive load comes from tool complexity rather than navigation complexity. Actors don't get lost spatially, but they can get lost in the feature set.

{/* ## Variants */}
{/* - *Menu-driven flat*. Primary tool access through menu bar. Most traditional (File, Edit, View, etc.) */}
{/* - *Palette-driven flat*. Floating or docked panels with tool groups. */}
{/* - *Command-first flat*.Keyboard command palette as primary access. Extremely efficient for experts. Learning curve. */}
