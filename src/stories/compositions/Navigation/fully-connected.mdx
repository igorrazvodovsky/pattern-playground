# Fully connected

Every page or screen links to all others through global navigation. Actors can reach any location from any other location with a single action.

Global navigation appears consistently across all pages—typically as a top menu, sidebar, or persistent header. The navigation might be single-level or deep and complex, but what defines fully connected is complete connectivity: any page to any other page in one hop.

## Behavioural position

### Supports
- [Navigating](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#navigating) — maximum efficiency for precise movement
- [Exploring](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#exploring) — freedom to follow curiosity without constraint
- [Browsing](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs#browsing) — can move laterally across sections whilst scanning

### Challenges
The presence of full global navigation everywhere is not without cost: it takes up space, clutters the screen, and incurs cognitive load.

## Variants

- Single-level: All navigation options at one level.
- Multi-level: Top navigation with secondary menus, or sidebars revealing subsections. Consider a hybrid with a [tree](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-hybrid-patterns--docs#multilevel-tree--fully-connected)
- [Priority+](../?path=/docs/components-priority--docs): Shows most important items, hides rest behind "more" menu.

### Complements
- [Command menu](../?path=/docs/patterns-command-menu--docs) — keyboard-driven alternative for power users
- [Breadcrumbs](../?path=/docs/patterns-breadcrumbs--docs) — supplements with location context
- [Search](../?path=/docs/compositions-search--docs) — alternative navigation path
- [Deep linking](../?path=/docs/primitives-deep-linking--docs) — enables direct access to any page
- [Navbar](../?path=/docs/compositions-navbar--docs), TODO: sidebar, TODO: mega menus, [tabs](../?path=/docs/components-tabs--docs) — implement this model
- Can be combined with [tree](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-hybrid-patterns--docs#multilevel-tree--fully-connected) as content grows
