# Hybrid navigation patterns

Hybrid patterns combine multiple models to balance competing needs, accommodate diverse content types, or serve different actor contexts.

## Hub and spoke + fully connected

Hub provides entry point and overview, but spokes include global navigation to all sections.

- Home screen or dashboard lists all main sections (hub behaviour)
- Each section accessible from hub
- But once in a section, global navigation enables cross-section movement without hub return (fully connected behaviour)

## Multilevel tree + fully connected

Global navigation for top level, tree navigation within sections, but also cross-section links where natural.

- Top-level pages fully connected via global menu (fully connected)
- Within sections, hierarchical navigation (multilevel tree)
- Contextual cross-section links bypass hierarchy when relationships exist

## Step by step + pyramid

Hub shows all steps in process, actors can navigate sequentially or jump to any step.

- Overview page lists all steps with descriptions (pyramid hub)
- From overview, can start at beginning or jump to specific step
- Within steps, back/next navigation available (step by step)
- Can return to overview anytime

> **Contrast with pure step by step:**
[Wizard](../?path=/docs/compositions-wizard--docs) is pure step by step—strict sequence, no jumping. This hybrid relaxes that constraint.

## Fully connected + pan and zoom

Global navigation for discrete sections, spatial navigation within rich content.

- Top-level navigation between named sections (fully connected)
- Within certain sections, continuous spatial navigation (pan and zoom)
- Switch between navigation paradigms based on content type

## Hub and spoke + flat navigation

Hub lists applications or workspaces, within each app all functions accessible.

- Launch screen or app switcher shows available tools/workspaces (hub)
- Select one to enter
- Within workspace, flat navigation model applies—all tools accessible, minimal location navigation

## Pyramid + multilevel tree

Multiple pyramids (sequences) organised in tree structure.

- Tree navigation for categories and sequences
- Within each sequence, pyramid model applies (hub + sequential)
