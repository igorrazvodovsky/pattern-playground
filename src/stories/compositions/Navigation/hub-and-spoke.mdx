# Hub and spoke

Hub lists major sections. Actors navigate to spokes, complete tasks, then return to hub for other sections. Spokes link only to hub, not to each other.

This structure trades navigation flexibility for cognitive simplicity—actors always know the path to any destination. Limited space in spokes constrains additional navigation options.

Most commonly found on mobile devices where screen space is limited and clear task focus is valuable. The iPhone home screen exemplifies the pattern: apps are spokes, the home screen is the hub.

## Behavioural position

**Supports**
- [Monitoring](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent--interaction--docs#monitoring) — hub can surface updates and status from all spokes
- [Transactional search](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent--interaction--docs#transactional-search) — direct selection from hub when target is known

**Constrains**
- [Navigating](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent--interaction--docs#navigating) — forces hub return even when destination is known
- [Browsing](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent--interaction--docs#browsing) — limits lateral movement between related spokes

The constraint on navigating can frustrate actors who know their destination but must take two-step journeys. However, for [exploring](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent--interaction--docs#exploring), the hub provides clear overview of available spaces.

## Variants

- Pure hub and spoke: Spokes contain no navigation to other spokes. Only path back is to hub. Best for completely independent sections.
- Hub and spoke with limited cross-links: Spokes can link to closely related spokes directly. Good for sections with clear relationships.
- Hub and spoke with global navigation: Hub provides entry point, but spokes include global navigation to all sections. Becomes [hybrid pattern](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-hybrid-patterns--docs#hub-and-spoke--fully-connected).

## States

### Hub states
- Active — currently displaying, actors select destination
- Returning — navigated back from spoke, may need visual indication of previous context
- Updated — indicators show changes in spokes (badges, highlights, notifications)

### Spoke states
- Active — currently displaying content/functionality
- Accessible — available from hub
- Restricted — greyed out or hidden based on permissions or prerequisites
- Notifying — has updates or requires attention (shown on hub)

{/* ## Agency implications */}

{/* - Locus: System-centric. Structure forces navigation decisions—must return to hub for cross-spoke movement. */}
{/* - Dynamics: Static allocation. Navigation paths are predefined and unchanging. */}
{/* - Granularity: High-level. Actor chooses destination spoke, but limited control over navigation path. */}

{/* **Control trade-off:** Reduces navigation [agency](../?path=/docs/foundations-agency--docs) but decreases cognitive load. Actors don't decide "how" to navigate, only "where" to go. This constraint is appropriate when: */}
{/* - Clear task separation is valuable */}
{/* - Reducing choice paralysis matters more than navigation efficiency */}
{/* - Mobile context limits space for persistent navigation */}

## Decision tree

### When to use

#### Content structure
- 5-8 major independent sections with distinct purposes
- Sections that function as separate mini-applications
- Mobile applications where screen space is premium

#### Behavioural needs
- Actors need clear overview of all options
- Tasks within spokes are focused and complete
- Cross-spoke navigation is infrequent
- Monitoring multiple areas is important

#### Agency preference
- System-guided navigation is acceptable
- Cognitive simplicity valued over navigation efficiency
- Clear structure reduces decision load

### When not to use

- Actors frequently need to move between spokes
- Content has natural hierarchies or relationships
- You have more than 8-10 sections (hub becomes cluttered)
- Desktop application with ample space for persistent navigation

## Related patterns

### Precursors
- [Flat navigation](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-flat-navigation--docs) → hub and spoke when items exceed screen capacity

### Complements
- [Command menu](../?path=/docs/patterns-command-menu--docs) — provides escape hatch for quick navigation without hub return
- [Deep linking](../?path=/docs/primitives-deeplinking--docs) — enables direct spoke access from external sources
- [Search](../?path=/docs/compositions-search--docs) — alternative to hub browsing for known destinations

### Follow-ups
- [Workspace](../?path=/docs/patterns-workspace--docs) — organisational containers often use hub and spoke
- Mobile app architectures with tab bars

### Alternatives
- [Fully connected](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-fully-connected--docs) for frequent cross-section movement
- [Multilevel tree](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-multilevel-tree--docs) for hierarchical relationships
- [Hub and spoke + fully connected](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-hybrid-patterns--docs#hub-and-spoke--fully-connected) to add cross-spoke navigation
