# Dashboard

## Variants

### Monitoring

User need: tracking operational data on a daily basis.

### Analytical tool

User needs
- get some insight without knowing what exactly I'm looking for
- draw conclusions with a certain algorithm in mind

### Entity page

User need: find out something about a certain entity.

Typically actor needs to apply several filters (sales turnover in a certain city, a certain product in a certain month, that is, you will need to apply several filters) to find an entity in question.

## Anatomy

While dashboards vary greatly depending on user needs they’re meant to fulfil, they can typically consist of two parts:

- Cards: each conveying a single metric or a group of closely related metrics.
- Layout: the arrangement of cards.
