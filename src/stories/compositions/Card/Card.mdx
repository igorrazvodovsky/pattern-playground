# Card

Cards are used to group related subjects in a container.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ CardStories.Card } />
</Canvas>

The container is the only required element in a card. All other elements are optional.

#### Attributes

<Story of={ CardStories.Attributes } />

#### Description

<Story of={ CardStories.Description } />

#### Media

Support for cards with one, multiple images, plus image-only cards.

#### Actions

Actions can be placed either inside the card's body or in its header. Details are covered in [dedicated section](#actions-1).

<Story of={ CardStories.Actions } />

### Element blocks

Each card is made up of element blocks. These blocks are all related to a single topic.
Blocks can have different levels of importance, depending on their priority.

#### Header

<Story of={ CardStories.Header } />

<Story of={ CardStories.Footer } />
