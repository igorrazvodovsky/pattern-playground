# Card

Cards are used to group related subjects in a container.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={ CardStories.Article } />
</Canvas>

## Anatomy

### Elements

The container is the only required element in a card. All other elements are optional.

<Story of={ CardStories.Basic } />

#### Attributes

<Story of={ CardStories.Attributes } />

#### Description

<Story of={ CardStories.Description } />

#### Media

Support for cards with one, multiple images, plus image-only cards.

<Story of={ CardStories.Image } />

#### Actions

Actions can be placed either inside the cardâ€™s body or in its header. Details are covered in [dedicated section](#actions-1).

<Story of={ CardStories.Actions } />

### Element blocks

Each card is made up of element blocks. These blocks are all related to a single topic.
Blocks can have different levels of importance, depending on their priority.

#### Header

<Story of={ CardStories.Header } />

#### Footer

<Story of={ CardStories.Footer } />

##### Aligned footer

{/* The `layout-grid` utility is used to align the contents of cards. */}

<Story of={ CardStories.FooterAligned } />

## Variants

{/* Containment */}
{/* Implicit containment */}
{/* An implicit container groups content or elements and may appear to have no edges, creating an implied boundary. Use implicit containment to group content and subtly reinforce the cohesion of a contained unit. */}
{/* Explicit containment */}
{/* An explicit container shows clear, visible boundaries. It can be tappable, and can be used to provide emphasis. */}
