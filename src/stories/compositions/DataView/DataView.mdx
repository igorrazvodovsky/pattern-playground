# Data view

Collection-scope representations within the [view](../?path=/docs/compositions-view--docs) system.
Displays a [collection](../?path=/docs/concepts-collection--docs), enabling actors to quickly scan, explore, and interact with [items](../?path=/docs/concepts-item--docs).
By combining varied representations with filtering, sorting, and grouping, data view provides tools for framing the data according to user needs.

{/* TODO: */}
{/* ✓ cards */}
{/* ✓ table */}
{/* ✓ representation switching */}
{/* ✓ attribute selection */}
{/* ✓ sorting */}
{/* ✗ filtering */}
{/* ✗ grouping */}

## Saved views

Saved views persist particular framings to reduce friction for repeat tasks, support different actor roles, and provide continuity across sessions.

- Developers define default views that align with the application's core use cases or intended actor journeys
- Administrators configure role-specific or task-specific views shared across teams or departments
- End users create personalised views tuned to their workflow or preferences


{/* ## Transitions */}
{/* Data views enable fluid navigation between collection and item: */}
{/* - Collection → Item summary: Select row in table to reveal expanded detail panel */}
{/* - Collection → Item detail: Click card to open modal with task-relevant information */}
{/* - Collection → Item full: Navigate from collection to dedicated item page */}
{/* - Item → Collection: Return to filtered/sorted collection view while preserving framing */}
