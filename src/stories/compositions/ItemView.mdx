# Item view

The system must allow each [entity](../?path=/docs/concepts-item--docs) to be represented in progressively richer forms, so that users can fluidly move between them depending on their task, without losing orientation or recognition.

## User needs

- People need to *recognise* an entity wherever it appears, but they donâ€™t always need all of its details.
- They want to stay in the *flow of their current task*, but sometimes they must shift into deep focus.
- Entities must sometimes act as *links to other places*, and sometimes as *self-sufficient centres of work*.

## Semantic level
Item representation is the combination of semantic level and UI element.

### Reference
- Purpose: identify and link to items
- Data: name, type
- Interaction: navigation

### Summary
- Purpose: quick assessment and comparison without leaving current task
- Data: key attributes, status, recent activity
- Interaction: navigation, actions for common operations

### Detail
- Purpose: inspection of most important information while maintaining context
- Data: relevant details for current task
- Interaction: editing, navigate to full page

### Full
- Purpose: Complete focus on single item
- Data: All data, history, relationships
- Interaction: editing, analysis, management

## UI element
- Inline: within text or structured UI.
- Contextual overlay: popover, hovercard.
- Transient container: modal, drawer, side panel.
- Dedicated view: section, panel, page, workspace, tab.
{/* TODO: Children of inline? */}
{/* - List: Sequential items in feeds or search results */}
{/* - Grid: Card-based layouts for visual browsing */}
{/* - Table: Data-dense views with sortable columns */}
{/* - Canvas: Spatial arrangements with relationships */}
{/* - Text: Inline references within documents */}

## Examples

### Reference as @mention + detail modal

<Story of = { Reference } />

### Reference as tag

TODO:

### Summary as list item {/* TODO: + drawer */}

<Story of = { SimpleTable } />

### Full view

<Story of = { ItemViewStories.Page } />
