# Item view

Varying ways an [item](../?path=/docs/concepts-item--docs) is rendered in UI — from small previews to full-page views, cards, nodes, etc. — reflect different levels of user intent, context, and task focus.

Different item view scopes provide progressive disclosure, allowing users to access the right level of detail for their current context without overwhelming them with unnecessary information.

## Scope of view

- Micro: Tooltip, inline tag, icon
- Mini: Hover card, compact drawer
- Mid: Dialog, side panel, expandable card
- Maxi: Full-page detail, dedicated workspace

### Examples

- Micro: inline [references](../?path=/docs/primitives-reference--docs) like `@Sarah Chen` and `@plan.pdf`
- Mini: hover cards showing detailed previews

<Story of = { ItemViewStories.Page } />

{/*
## Representations

- Card
- Node
- Canvas block
- Inline block
*/}

## Interaction mode

- Preview: click-to-expand, zoom
- Inspect: Focused drill-in, modal
- Edit: In-place or full-form
- Transform: Object reshaping (e.g., convert to template)
