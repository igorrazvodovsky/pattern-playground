## Description

Global navigation component that provides consistent access to main sections across an application or website. Nav bars typically appear as horizontal top bars or vertical sidebars with persistent visibility.

## Navigation model

**[Fully Connected](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-fully-connected--docs)** - Nav bars are the primary UI implementation of the fully connected navigation model, where every page links to all major sections through global navigation. See [Information Architecture foundation](../?path=/docs/foundations-information-architecture--docs) for the broader structural pattern.

Nav bars can also implement:
- **[Multilevel Tree](../?path=/docs/compositions-structure-multilevel-tree--docs)** - when using dropdowns or expandable menus for hierarchical navigation
- **Hybrid models** - combining global access with contextual navigation
