# Conversation

Building on the [foundational understanding](../?path=/docs/foundations-conversation--docs) that all interactions are conversational, this pattern focuses on designing explicit conversational interfaces where dialogue is the primary interaction mode.
Conversation patterns create structured dialogue between users and systems, supporting natural back-and-forth exchanges that adapt to context and intent over multiple turns.

## Interaction-type specific patterns
Conversation patterns flex based on the actors involved:
TODO: Human â†”ï¸Ž Human, Human â†”ï¸Ž LLM, Human â†”ï¸Ž Agent, Human xN â†”ï¸Ž Agent, Agent â†”ï¸Ž Agent?

## Conversation stages
Conversation unfolds over time, often nonlinearly:
TODO: pre-conversation, early turns, mid-flow, transition to action, error paths, post-conversation, ...

## Dialogue forms
Conversations are not all alike:
TODO: inquiry, conversation, instruction, debate

## [Behaviour](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs)-oriented patterns

Conversation patterns align with the behavioural framework's turn-taking structure. Each behaviour mode creates natural conversational rhythms:

- **Motivated movement**: clear query-response cycles where actors state intent and systems provide targeted responses
- **Delightful discovery**: system-initiated turns that invite exploration, with actors responding through engagement
- **Foggy finding**: collaborative problem-solving where both actors and systems contribute to clarification

The [seekâ€“useâ€“share framework](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs) provides temporal structure for extended conversations, while cooperation maxims ensure each turn respects actor agency and intent.
