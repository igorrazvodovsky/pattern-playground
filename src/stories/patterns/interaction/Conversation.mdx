# Conversation

A dynamic, iterative exchange between actors, in which mutual understanding, intent, and action emerge through co-adaptation across turns.

## Cooperation
To function, conversation must be cooperative. Griceâ€™s conversational maxims (extended with "politeness" by Lakoff) provide a foundation for this cooperation:
- Quantity â€“ providing just enough information to be helpful.
- Quality â€“ offering contributions that are accurate and grounded.
- Relation â€“ staying relevant and appropriate to the context, intent, or thread.
- Manner â€“ communicating clearly and accessibly; avoid ambiguity.
- Politeness â€“ being respectful of agency, boundaries, and tone.

## General conversational patterns
Supporting rhythm, repair, and rapport in interactions:
- Turn-taking & pacing
- Providing Information
- Clarification
- Error handling & recovery
- Feedback & confirmation
- Related patterns

## Interaction-type specific patterns
Conversation patterns flex based on the actors involved:
TODO: Human â†”ï¸Ž Human, Human â†”ï¸Ž LLM, Human â†”ï¸Ž Agent, Human xN â†”ï¸Ž Agent, Agent â†”ï¸Ž Agent?

## Conversation stages
Conversation unfolds over time, often nonlinearly:
TODO: pre-conversation, early turns, mid-flow, transition to action, error paths, post-conversation, ...

## Dialogue forms
Conversations are not all alike:
TODO: inquiry, conversation, instruction, debate

## [Behaviour](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs)-oriented patterns

Conversation patterns align with the behavioural framework's turn-taking structure. Each behaviour mode creates natural conversational rhythms:

- **Motivated movement**: clear query-response cycles where actors state intent and systems provide targeted responses
- **Delightful discovery**: system-initiated turns that invite exploration, with actors responding through engagement
- **Foggy finding**: collaborative problem-solving where both actors and systems contribute to clarification

The [seekâ€“useâ€“share framework](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs) provides temporal structure for extended conversations, while cooperation maxims ensure each turn respects actor agency and intent.
