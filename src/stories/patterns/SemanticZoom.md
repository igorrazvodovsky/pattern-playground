# Semantic zoom

Controlling the [density](../?path=/docs/foundations-density--docs#information-density) of a GUI through dynamic, user-driven transformations of information representation: showing different types and amounts of information at different scales.

- Scale-dependent swap: at defined thresholds, switches to a different, more legible representation (eg, text turns into an abstract; node clouds condense to clusters).
- In-place unfolding: expand/contract without navigation; preserve spatial anchors. (Think StretchText done for any medium.)  ï¿¼
- Context-preserving motion: animate smoothly; avoid teleporting popups or modal detours.

## User-driven detail control
Users determine their own information needs moment by moment, rather than being constrained by pre-packaged interface decisions. This shifts agency from designer to user.

## Context preservation
As detail levels change, surrounding context remains visible and comprehensible.

## Multi-level abstraction
Information exists simultaneously at multiple levels of detailâ€”from high-level summaries to granular specificsâ€”with smooth transitions between them.

### Focus plus context
Borrowing from fish-eye distortion techniques, semantic zoom allows simultaneous focus on details while maintaining awareness of the broader information landscape.
