# Tag

Method of classifying content through keyword labels that enable multi-faceted organisation and discovery. Unlike hierarchical taxonomies that force single-path categorisation, tags allow items to belong to multiple topic dimensions simultaneously. Tags may be applied by users, systems, or curators.

## Forces

- Controlled vocabulary vs open tagging: curated taxonomies provide consistency and prevent redundancy, but flexible tagging captures domain-specific language
- Single vs multiple classification: hierarchical categories may force exclusive placement, whilst tags allow content to exist across multiple topic facets simultaneously
- Precision vs discoverability: specific tags improve targeted search, but broad tags increase content visibility
- Stability vs ephemerality: some tags remain evergreen, while others fade away with passing trends.
- Manual vs automated tagging: human-applied tags capture nuanced meaning, but system-generated tags scale efficiently

{/* ## Variants */}

{/* ### By interactivity */}
{/* - Read-only tags: Static labels for categorisation without interactive functionality */}
{/* - Removable tags: Dismissible labels commonly used in search filters and active selections */}
{/* - Selectable tags: Toggle-based filtering enabling multi-faceted browsing */}

{/* ### By scope */}
{/* - Personal tags: Private organisation visible only to the creator */}
{/* - Shared tags: Collaborative classification within defined groups */}
{/* - Public tags: Open folksonomy accessible across the system, enabling social discovery */}

{/* ### By source */}
{/* - User-generated: Actors apply tags based on personal understanding or organisation needs, creating folksonomy when shared */}
{/* - System-generated: Automated tagging through content analysis, entity extraction, or algorithmic classification */}
{/* - Curated: Editorial or expert-applied tags maintaining controlled vocabulary */}
{/* - Hybrid: Combination of user and system tagging, often with suggested tags that users can accept or modify */}

{/* ### By format */}
{/* - Free-form tags: Unrestricted keywords */}
{/* - Hashtags: Prefixed with #, standard in social platforms, automatically linkable */}
{/* - Controlled vocabulary: Tags drawn from predefined taxonomy or ontology */}


## When to use

- Content maps to multiple conceptual categories rather than single hierarchical placement
- Faceted browsing and filtering enhance discoverability
- The system contains sufficient content volume to benefit from topic-based organisation
- Classification needs to scale beyond manual curation capabilities
- Diverse perspectives or domain vocabularies enrich content organisation

## Implementation considerations

- Tags should link to filtered views showing all similarly tagged content
- Search functionality must index tagged content
- For user-generated tags: provide autocomplete to encourage consistent vocabulary whilst allowing new terms
- For system-generated tags: communicate confidence levels and allow correction
- Consider tag frequency thresholds to surface trending or popular topics
- Provide merge capabilities for synonymous tags in open folksonomy systems
- Balance tag proliferation against discoverability through suggested tags or controlled vocabularies
