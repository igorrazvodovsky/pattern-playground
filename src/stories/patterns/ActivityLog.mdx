# Activity log

Who, what, and when – chronological list of the actors' actions.

<Story of={ActivityLogStories.Basic} />

## Event anatomy

- Actor: user, other humans, system, LLM, etc.
- Activity: what the actor did
- Object: The specific item that was affected by the action
- When: when the action happened
- Available actions

## Examples

### Human actions

...

### [Bot](../?path=/docs/patterns-bot--docs) actions and reasoning

<Story of={ActivityLogStories.LLMReasoning} />

## Related patterns

### Concepts

- [Task](../?path=/docs/concepts-task--docs) - Records task actions, progress, and outcomes for review and accountability
- [Event](../?path=/docs/concepts-event--docs) - underlying data structure for each activity log entry
- [Event log](../?path=/docs/concepts-event-log--docs) - chronological collection that ActivityLog pattern visualises

### Precursors

- [Bot](../?path=/docs/patterns-bot--docs) - actions and reasoning are tracked and displayed in the activity log.
- [Transparent reasoning](../?path=/docs/patterns-transparent-reasoning--docs) - provides the detailed reasoning steps that get recorded in the activity log.

### Components

- Uses a [timeline](../?path=/docs/components-timeline--docs) with embedded [progress indicator](../?path=/docs/components-progress-indicator--docs).
- Depends on [details](../?path=/docs/primitives-details--docs) for [progressive disclosure](../?path=/docs/patterns-progressive-disclosure--docs) of the event details.

### Follow-ups

- [Collaboration](../?path=/docs/patterns-collaboration--docs) - Uses activity logs to provide transparency and accountability in shared workspaces

### Complementary patterns

- [Feed](../?path=/docs/patterns-feed--docs) – distinct from activity logs; feeds aggregate content _of interest to_ users from diverse sources, whilst logs are histories of _actions taken by_ a specific entity
