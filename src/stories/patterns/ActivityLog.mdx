- [Bot](../?path=/docs/patterns-bot--docs) - actions and reasoning are tracked and displayed in the activity log.
- [Transparent reasoning](../?path=/docs/patterns-communication-transparent-reasonining--docs) - provides the detailed reasoning steps that get recorded in the activity log.

### Components

- Uses a [timeline](../?path=/docs/components-timeline--docs) with embedded [progress indicator](../?path=/docs/components-progress-indicator--docs).
- Depends on [details](../?path=/docs/primitives-details--docs) for [progressive disclosure](../?path=/docs/patterns-progressive-disclosure--docs) of the event details.

### Follow-ups

- [Collaboration](../?path=/docs/patterns-collaboration--docs) - Uses activity logs to provide transparency and accountability in shared workspaces
