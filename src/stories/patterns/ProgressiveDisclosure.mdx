# Progressive disclosure

Prioritize key information and core features while deferring secondary elements to additional views.
The approach prevents overwhelming users when presenting large amounts of content.
By revealing hidden elements only when triggered, you maintain full functionality while significantly reducing
initial cognitive load and creating a cleaner interface.

{/* ### Scaffolding via *greying out* */}
{/* When designing layered interfaces, prefer **greying out** (ghosting) unavailable features over hiding them completely. */}
{/* - **Why:** Seeing the disabled controls helps users build a mental model of *where* advanced features live. */}
{/* - **Result:** Users know the capability exists, reducing the need to re-learn the interface when they transition to the expert layer. */}

{/* # Best practices

- Clearly distinguishing between the primary and secondary tasks.
- Creating clear trigger actions for secondary content.
- Minimising nested disclosures; simplifing features with multiple levels.*/}

- [Density](../?path=/docs/qualities-density--docs) - progressive disclosure manages information and visual density by deferring secondary content
- [Details](../?path=/docs/primitives-details--docs) provides the core expand/collapse functionality
- [Dialog](../?path=/docs/components-dialog--docs) provides the UI container for disclosed content that
  needs more space
- [Activity log](../?path=/docs/patterns-activity-log--docs) - uses progressive disclosure for event details
- [Bot](../?path=/docs/patterns-bot--docs) - helps bots operate with incremental complexity
- [Explanation](../?path=/docs/patterns-explanation--docs) - assists in transitioning between different levels of detail
- [Focus and context](../?path=/docs/patterns-focus-and-context--docs) - can be combined for layered information presentation
- May support [learnability](../?path=/docs/qualities-learnability--docs) by allowing users to master value-generating tasks before introducing advanced configuration.
