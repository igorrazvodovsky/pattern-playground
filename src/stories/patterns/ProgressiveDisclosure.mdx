# Progressive disclosure

Prioritize essential information and core features while deferring secondary elements to additional views.
The approach prevents overwhelming users when presenting large amounts of content.
By revealing hidden elements only when triggered, you maintain full functionality while significantly reducing
initial cognitive load and creating a cleaner interface.

# Best practices

- Clearly distinguishing between the primary and secondary tasks.
- Creating clear trigger actions for secondary content.
- Minimising nested disclosures; simplifing features with multiple levels.
