# Good defaults

Pre-fill fields and pre-select options with intelligent guesses to save user effort and reduce errors.
Defaults also serve as *examples*, showing users the expected answer format.

## Types of defaults

### Mass defaults
Apply to all users universally.
- Benign defaults: The "best guess" for the majority (e.g., standard shipping).
- Occasional-use interfaces: In installers or setup wizards, users often prefer "whatever the system decides" to save effort.
- Smart defaults: Optimization based on general data (e.g., current location, time, or session metadata).
- Random defaults: Arbitrary assignment when no preference exists.

### Personalized defaults
Tailored to the individual actor.
- Persistent defaults: Based on the user's past choices (e.g., "Use my last address").
- Adaptive defaults: Updated in real-time based on immediate context or behavior.

## Risks & ethical considerations

- *Dark patterns*: "Hidden options" or pre-checking consent boxes (e.g., for marketing) exploits the default effect to the user's detriment.
- *Social signaling*: In some contexts, the default changes the meaning of the choice (e.g., opting out feels like a stronger rejection than not opting in).
- *Sensitive data risks*: Avoid defaults for identity (gender, citizenship) or sensitive choices. Pre-filling these can make users uncomfortable or imply assumptions.
- *Status quo bias*: Users rarely change defaults.
- *Invisibility*: Users might not notice a default value and submit incorrect data.
- *Blindness*: If a user can skip a field, the question might not "register" mentally, reducing their understanding of the system settings.
