### Precursors

<div>
- *Search* establishes user familiarity with typing to filter results, setting expectations that input fields serve navigation and filtering tasks.
- A command palette often extends or consolidates *keyboard shortcut* functionality, making them easier to discover and use.
- [Keyboard key](../?path=/docs/primitives-keyboard-key--docs)
- *Navigation* menu establishes the baseline structure that a command menu can later streamline or augment.
</div>

### Complementary

<div>
- *Autocomplete* supports command menu functionality by reducing typing effort and increasing discoverability of commands.
- *AI assistance* can help users find relevant commands when exact matches aren't available.

### Follow-ups

<div>
- *Action history* may streamlines repetitive workflows
