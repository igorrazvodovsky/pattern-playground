## Global

Pop up in the middle of the screen...

## Local

Can also be used to support local functions, e.g. in filters or local search.

## AI-Powered Suggestions

When users search for commands that don't match existing ones, the command menu can leverage AI to suggest relevant actions. This helps users discover functionality and reduces friction when they're looking for something specific but don't know the exact command name.
