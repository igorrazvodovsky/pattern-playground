## Global

Pop up in the middle of the screen...

<Story of={ CommandMenuStories.Dialog } />

<Story of={ FilteringStory } />

## Related patterns

### Precursors

- *Search* establishes user familiarity with typing to filter results, setting expectations that input fields serve navigation and filtering tasks.
- A command palette often extends or consolidates *keyboard shortcut* functionality, making them easier to discover and use.
- [Keyboard key](../?path=/docs/primitives-keyboard-key--docs)
- *Navigation* menu establishes the baseline structure that a command menu can later streamline or augment.

### Complementary

- *Autocomplete* supports command menu functionality by reducing typing effort and increasing discoverability of commands.
- [Embedded intelligence](../?path=/docs/patterns-embedded-intelligence--docs) can help users find relevant commands when exact matches aren't available.

### Follow-ups

{/* - *Action history* may streamline repetitive workflows */}
- *Bookmarks*
