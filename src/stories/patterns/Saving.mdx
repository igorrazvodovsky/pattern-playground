# Saving

Modern UX expectations generally favour reduced friction (e.g., **autosave**), but there are still scenarios where **manual** saving or a **hybrid** model is beneficial.

Also, different approaches to saving may be employed depending on how priorities are balanced between UX, implementation costs, and the general product considertaions.

## Methods

### Autosave

The system automatically saves changes, typically triggered by keystrokes (with a brief delay), interval-based timers (e.g., every few seconds), changes in focus or blur of editable fields.
<div>
✓ Pros
- Minimal effort: Users don’t have to remember to click *Save*.
- Reduced risk of data loss: If the user closes the tab or the system crashes, changes are already stored.
- Fluid Experience: Users can iterate quickly without pausing.


✗ Cons
- Lack of explicit control: users may be uncertain about precisely when or whether changes are finalised.
- Complex error and conflict handling: more frequent saves mean more frequent chances for conflicts or errors.
- Potential overwriting: In multi-user environments, autosave may overwrite another collaborator’s work without user awareness unless carefully managed.
</div>
### Manual save

The user explicitly clicks a *Save* button (or triggers a keyboard shortcut) to commit changes.
<div>
✓ Pros
- User control: the user intentionally decides when changes are stored.
- Simplicity in some workflows: less background syncing or conflict resolution is needed.
- Clear feedback loop: The user sees the result of each save action in a predictable step.

✗ Cons
- Risk of data loss: If a user forgets to save or the system fails, all unsaved changes are lost.
- Interrupts flow: repeatedly hitting “Save” can be tiresome and break a user’s focus.
</div>
### Hybrid approach: autosave draft → manual commit

The system autosaves a draft or staging version frequently. A *Commit* or *Publish* action finalises changes.
<div>
✓ Pros
- Safety net: drafts are preserved automatically, so the user rarely loses work.
- Clarity: the user can explicitly finalise or publish only when ready.
- Controlled flow: combines user control (final commit) with the safety of autosave (draft).

✗ Cons
- Implementation complexity: multiple states (draft vs. published) mean more logic in the system.
- User confusion: some may not realise their changes are in draft until they manually publish.
- Inconsistent data: If the user forgets to publish, other users may see outdated data.
</div>
### Choosing a method

Autosaving seems like a overall best default from the UX point of view with falling back to hybrid for cases when saving directly is unwanted.

### Consequences of mixing saving methods in one system

For various reasons, the app may mix manual and automatic saving, which can be a bit confusing for users. Here are a few things to consider:
<div>
- Unclear mental model: Users may wonder, “Is it saved or not?” if they see autosave messaging but also a “Save” button.
- Potential data state mismatch: draft changes might conflict with the final published state, requiring robust reconciliation.
- UI complexity: additional indicators and instructions are needed to differentiate “draft” and “saved” states.
</div>
## Reversibility

It's always nice to have to be able to undo changes.

## Feedback

<div>
Users should always know whether their work is saved or if an error occurred.
- Real-time indicators: show a subtle “Saving…” spinner or message after user input.
- Confirmation messages: display “Draft saved” or “Changes saved” once the action is complete.
- Timestamp or status: Provide the last saved timestamp (e.g., “Saved at 10:12 AM”).
- Error handling: notify the user if saving fails (e.g., offline or server error) and offer next steps (retry, copy data, etc.).
</div>

## TODO: Conflict resolution

Conflicts can occur when multiple users or sessions edit simultaneously, or when offline changes are synced.
{/* - Provide a clear, minimal-friction interface for resolving conflicts (e.g., highlight differences, show user attributions). */}
{/* - Offer version logs so users can trace who changed what. */}

## TODO: Offline support & network/device failure

<div>
- Local drafts/queue: store unsynced changes locally and push them when the user reconnects.
- Visual indicators: let users know they’re offline and that changes are queued.
- Conflict handling: if others changed the record while the user was offline, present a merge flow upon reconnection.
</div>

## TODO: Redirecting upon creation of new items

<div>
When creating a new record or entity, decide whether to:
- Stay in context: the user remains on the same form or page to continue editing.
- Redirect to newly created item.
- Offer a choice: e.g. “create Another” vs. “go to created Item.”
