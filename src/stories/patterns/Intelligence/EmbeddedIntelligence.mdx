# Embedded intelligence

Embedded intelligence integrates LLMs directly into familiar workflows and interfaces, not as standalone tools but as extensions of users’ existing ways of thinking and acting.

## Understanding intent

{/* Embedded intelligence can be seen as an alternative to [chatting](../?path=/docs/compositions-messaging--docs) with a [bot](../?path=/docs/patterns-bot--docs). */}

Embedded intelligence is about integrating intent detection seamlessly into interfaces. Good embedded intelligence anticipates and supports user intent proactively. It adjusts its behaviours or recommendations based on inferred goals, context, and user states.

### Intent detection

TODO: Keywords, user actions, navigation paths, context indicators...

### Intent interpretation

TODO: Goal inference, context understanding, user state analysis...

{/* ### Patterns for capturing and interpreting intent */}

## Related patterns

### Precursors

- Extends [adaptation](../?path=/docs/foundations-adaptation--docs) by mixing deterministic (rule-driven) and probabilistic (inferred or predicted) responses, creating dynamic, context-sensitive interactions..
- Enhances the system’s [agency](../?path=/docs/foundations-agency--docs) by enabling autonomous decisions and actions.

### Follow-ups

- Embedded intelligence aligns well with [command menu](../?path=/docs/compositions-command-menu--docs).
- [Filtering](../?path=/docs/patterns-filtering--docs) is an example of using embedded intelligence in command menu that it uses for searching filter attributes and value There AI is used to interpret complex queries.
- In [focus and context](../?path=/docs/patterns-focus-and-context--docs) embedded intelligence reveals the invisible by suggesting inferred connections.
