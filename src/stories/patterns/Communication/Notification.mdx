# Notification

Letting users know what's happening in the system - whether something worked, failed, or needs attention.
It's one of three ways to give [status feedback](../?path=/docs/patterns-communication-status-feedback--docs). Every notification has three parts: _purpose_, _type_, and _scope_.

## Purpose

Signifies the intention and the emotional tone of the information being communicated. Each status is associated with a specific color and icon, ensuring a consistent and universal user experience.

- Information
- Success
- Warning
- Error

## Type

Allows to tailor the disruptiveness of the notification.

### Inline

<strong className="success flex"><iconify-icon className="icon" icon="ph:check-circle-fill"></iconify-icon>Success</strong>

### [Toast](../?path=/docs/primitives-toast--docs)

Toasts are non-disruptive messages that appear in the interface to provide quick, at-a-glance feedback on the outcome of an action.

<Story of={Toast} />

### [Callout](../?path=/docs/primitives-callout--docs)

Callouts are used to highlight important information contextually.

<Story of={Callout} />

### [Dialog](../?path=/docs/components-dialog--docs)

Used only when the message is critical and needs the userâ€™s immediate attention or action. Modals persist until users engage with them and only disappear when dismissed by the user.

<Story of={Dialog} />
