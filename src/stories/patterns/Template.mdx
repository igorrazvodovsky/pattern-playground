# Template

Predefined, reusable structures that guide actors in creating consistent items.

Some users can build nicely-formatted documents from scratch using atomic tools — the equivalent of hammers, saws, and chisels. But many require more: the equivalent of an unfinished table or chair that they can sand and paint. Templates serve this scaffolding function, bridging the gap between capability and intent.

## User needs

Reduce cognitive load, standardise content quality, support collaborative workflows.

## Examples

- Document templates: blank page, essay, plan, report, letter, proposal
- Structured prompts
- Prompt/template galleries (Bench-like)
- Collaborative canvas suggestions (FigJam-like)
- Workflow templates
