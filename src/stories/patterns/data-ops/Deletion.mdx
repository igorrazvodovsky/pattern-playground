# Deletion

The controlled removal of data from a system, balancing user confidence with protection against accidental loss. Deletion exists in tension with creation and modification, requiring careful consideration of consequences, reversibility, and user intent.

## Anatomy

- Trigger: The initiating action
- Confirmation: Verification of intent (varies by consequence severity)
- Execution: The actual deletion operation
- Feedback: Communication of result
- Recovery: Mechanism for reversal when available

## Variants by confirmation method

### No confirmation with/-out undo
For low-consequence actions that can be easily reversed. The deletion happens immediately, followed by a toast notification with an undo option.

### Inline
The delete button transforms into a confirmation state, requiring a second click to complete the action.

<Story of={InlineConfirmationStories.Default} />

### Modal
A dialog presents the consequences and requires explicit confirmation.

<Story of={DialogStories.DeletionConfirmation} />

### Typed
For critical, irreversible actions, users must type a specific phrase to proceed.

## Integration with save/cancel workflow

Deletion can be part of a broader editing session where changes are staged until explicitly saved. This approach treats the save button as the confirmation mechanism for all changes, including deletions.

Benefits
- Implicit confirmation: The save action confirms all changes, reducing confirmation fatigue
- Batch review: Users can see all pending changes before committing
- Safe experimentation: Users can try different configurations without immediate consequences
- Unified mental model: All changes follow the same commit pattern

This approach aligns with the [Saving](../?path=/docs/patterns-data-operations-saving--docs#save-cancel-as-confirmation-mechanism) pattern's hybrid model, providing a safety net while maintaining user control. It's particularly effective for:
- Form-based interfaces with multiple fields
- Configuration screens with interconnected settings
- Bulk editing sessions
- Scenarios where deletions affect calculated values or totals

## States

### Deletion states
- Available: Delete action is accessible
- Confirming: Awaiting user confirmation
- Deleting: Operation in progress
- Deleted: Successfully removed
- Failed: Deletion unsuccessful
- Recovering: Undo in progress

### Visual states
- Pending deletion: Marked for deletion but not yet committed
- Soft deleted: Logically deleted but recoverable
- Hard deleted: Permanently removed

## Recovery mechanisms

- [Undo](../?path=/docs/patterns-undo--docs)
- Soft delete: Items moved to archive; configurable retention period
- Version history
