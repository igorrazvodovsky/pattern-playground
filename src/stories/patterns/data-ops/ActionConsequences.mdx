# Action consequences

A framework for evaluating the severity and reversibility of user actions to determine appropriate safeguards and confirmation methods. This pattern helps balance friction with protection, ensuring dangerous actions are adequately guarded while keeping routine tasks fluid.

## Consequence dimensions

### Time to recover
The primary metric for evaluating consequence severity:
- Seconds: Trivial to recreate (typing a word, selecting an option)
- Minutes: Minor effort required (filling a form, configuring settings)
- Hours: Significant work to restore (complex document, detailed configuration)
- Days: Major reconstruction needed (project data, accumulated content)
- Irreversible: Cannot be recovered

### Scope of impact
Who is affected by the action:
- Self only: Affects only the actor
- Team: Impacts immediate collaborators
- Organisation: Affects broader groups
- External users: Impacts customers or third parties
- System-wide: Affects all users and operations

### Cascade effects
Secondary consequences triggered by the action:
- Isolated: No dependencies or related effects
- Limited cascade: Few predictable dependencies
- Complex cascade: Multiple interrelated effects
- Unpredictable: Consequences difficult to foresee

## Confirmation methods by severity

### No confirmation
- Instantly reversible (undo available)
- No meaningful data loss
- Part of normal workflow

### Passive confirmation
- Easily reversible
- Minor inconvenience if accidental
- Low-frequency mistakes expected

### Inline confirmation
- Moderate effort to recover
- Clear user intent likely
- Context should be maintained

### Modal interruption
- Significant consequences
- Side effects need explanation
- User should pause to consider

### Friction confirmation
- Critical or irreversible
- Wide-reaching impact
- Accidental activation catastrophic

## Factors that reduce severity

- Undo (or trash/archive, version history) availability
- Staging/draft mechanisms
- Review before committing
- Scheduled execution

## Context-specific adjustments
- User expertise: Adjust confirmation based on user familiarity
- Frequency of action: More common actions may need less friction
