# Onboarding

First-time experiences that establish mental models and demonstrate value.

## New to the service

Onboarding is the moment where a person becomes an active participant: they learn what kind of system this is, what actions are possible, and what will happen when they act.

- Seeding: Show locked/greyed-out features early to build a mental map.
- Just-in-time: Teach mechanics only when the user is about to encounter the problem.
- Sandbox: Allow safe failure during the initial learning phase.
- Establish role and goal: who the user is in this context and what "success" looks like.
- Orient the user: what objects exist, where state lives, and how to navigate.
- Make constraints feel intrinsic: communicate limits in the language of the domain, not as arbitrary rules.
- Support safe exploration: drafts, undo/redo, previews, and "try it" spaces.
- Make agency legible: if automations/bots will act, show what they can do, when they'll do it, and how to override.
- Delivery mechanisms: [Guided tours and overlays](../?path=/docs/patterns-help--docs) introduce features without requiring pedagogic commands.

## New or updated feature

New capability is a change in context: it can be delightful, but it can also break common ground and disrupt ongoing work.

- Preserve continuity: keep existing workflows working; avoid surprise changes to established affordances.
- Announce what changed and why: connect the feature to the user's goals.
- Let people defer and return: make discovery asynchronous and non-blocking.
- Provide reversible activation: opt-in, "try it", or easy rollback to prevent fear of commitment.
- In collaboration, coordinate participants: show who will see the change, how shared state is affected, and what new expectations exist.

## Generative onboarding

Two approaches to getting users started:

- Traditional: show empty state → teach tools → user creates from scratch (_learning then doing_)
- Generative: ask for intent → generate draft → user refines (_observing then refining_)

Generative onboarding lets users learn by editing working content rather than creating from nothing.

### Precursors
- [Learnability](../?path=/docs/foundations-learnability--docs) – the foundation supporting value demonstration.

### Follow-ups
- [Mastery](../?path=/docs/patterns-mastery--docs) – building proficiency after initial learning.

### Complementary
- [Help](../?path=/docs/patterns-help--docs) – provides just-in-time assistance.
- [Empty state](../?path=/docs/patterns-states-empty-state--docs) – often the canvas for onboarding.
