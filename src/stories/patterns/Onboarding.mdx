# Onboarding

The initial experience that establishes mental models and demonstrates value, transforming a person into an active participant.

## New to the service

Onboarding is the moment where a person becomes an active participant: they learn what kind of system this is, what actions are possible, and what will happen when they act.

- Seeding: Show locked/greyed-out features early to build a mental map.
- Just-in-time: Teach mechanics only when the user is about to encounter the problem.
- Sandbox: Allow safe failure during the initial learning phase.
- Establish role and goal: who the user is in this context and what "success" looks like.
- Orient the user: what objects exist, where state lives, and how to navigate.
- Make constraints feel intrinsic: communicate limits in the language of the domain, not as arbitrary rules.
- Support safe exploration: drafts, undo/redo, previews, and "try it" spaces.
- Make agency legible: if automations/bots will act, show what they can do, when they'll do it, and how to override.
- Delivery mechanisms: [Guided tours and overlays](../?path=/docs/patterns-help--docs) introduce features without requiring pedagogic commands.

## New or updated feature

New capability is a change in context: it can be delightful, but it can also break common ground and disrupt ongoing work.

- Preserve continuity: keep existing workflows working; avoid surprise changes to established affordances.
- Announce what changed and why: connect the feature to the user's goals.
- Let people defer and return: make discovery asynchronous and non-blocking.
- Provide reversible activation: opt-in, "try it", or easy rollback to prevent fear of commitment.
- In collaboration, coordinate participants: show who will see the change, how shared state is affected, and what new expectations exist.

## Generative onboarding

Two approaches to getting users started:

- Traditional: show empty state → teach tools → user creates from scratch (_learning then doing_)
- Generative: ask for intent → generate draft → user refines (_observing then refining_)

Generative onboarding lets users learn by editing working content rather than creating from nothing.

## Joining systems in use

In actively used systems, new users face a third challenge beyond "how does this work?" and "what can I do?"—they must also understand *what's already here*.

Configurations, workflows, data structures, and naming conventions created by predecessors embody institutional decisions. Without context, these can appear arbitrary or confusing.

- *Surface institutional decisions:* Why was this configured this way? What problem did it solve?
- *Connect to domain rationale:* What real-world constraint does this structure reflect?
- *Enable [archaeology](../?path=/docs/patterns-activity-log--docs):* Let users trace how things came to be—history, authorship, related changes
- *Identify local conventions:* What naming patterns, categorisations, or workflows are established here?

This is [domain learnability](../?path=/docs/qualities-learnability--docs) applied to accumulated context.
The system holds knowledge not just about the domain in general, but about *this organisation's* relationship to the domain.
