# Onboarding

First-time experiences that establish mental models and demonstrate value.

## New to the service

...

## New or updated feature

...

## Generative onboarding
{/* Traditional onboarding relies on *delayed gratification*: Learn the UI first, verify value later (if you stay). */}
{/* AI flips this to *immediate engagement*: The system provides "working content" from start, allowing the user to learn by *editing* rather than creating from scratch. */}
- Old way: show empty container → explain how to fill it → user acts
- New way: ask for *minimum viable context* → generate draft → user refines

{/* are used when you want to guide the user AND give them some foundation to start with. It's an interactive guide where the user is using the product itself, so you give them more than an empty state. */}
