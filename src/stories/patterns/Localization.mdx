# Localization

The orchestration concern that re-tunes interface when context shifts across linguistic, cultural, or regional boundaries.
Every pattern in the system carries implicit assumptions about language, culture, and convention.

## Layers

### Linguistic

Surface text: translation, plural rules, grammatical gender, script direction.
{/* Text expansion and contraction have direct layout consequences — German compound nouns run 30–40% longer than English equivalents; Chinese often contracts. Controlled vocabularies from [information architecture](../?path=/docs/foundations-information-architecture--docs) need locale-specific variants, not word-for-word translation. Tone shifts documented in the [text lens](../?path=/docs/patterns-text-lens--docs) may lack clean equivalents across languages — English "friendly casual" doesn't map to Japanese keigo registers. */}

### Cultural

Communication directness (high-context vs low-context cultures), formality expectations, colour and iconography symbolism, culturally-situated mental models.

### Regional

Date, time, number, currency, and address formats. Measurement units. First day of week. Legal and regulatory requirements (GDPR, data residency, accessibility mandates). Links to [data entry](../?path=/docs/patterns-data-entry--docs) (forgiving format parsing), [good defaults](../?path=/docs/patterns-good-defaults--docs) (smart defaults from location), [settings](../?path=/docs/patterns-settings--docs) (language and timezone preferences), [privacy](../?path=/docs/qualities-privacy--docs).

{/* ## Locale resolution */}
{/* How the system determines locale: browser signal → account setting → URL parameter → explicit selection. */}
{/* The cascade should be transparent — actors should understand *why* the interface appears in a given language and how to change it. */}

{/* ## Format adapters */}
{/* Data display adjusting to locale — dates, numbers, currencies rendered through locale-aware formatters rather than hardcoded patterns. The same underlying value appears differently depending on context. Links to [data entry](../?path=/docs/patterns-data-entry--docs). */}

{/* ## Layout response */}
{/* Accommodating text expansion (German, Finnish), contraction (Chinese, Korean), RTL script direction (Arabic, Hebrew), and content density variation. Layout must flex without breaking hierarchy or truncating meaning. */}

## Variants

### Full localisation

All four layers adapted — linguistic, cultural, regional, contextual. Reserved for areas where investment justifies the depth. Requires ongoing maintenance as language evolves and cultural norms shift.

### Partial localisation

Translate the interface, format the data, defer deeper cultural adaptation.

### Community localisation

Actor-contributed translations. Requires review workflows, quality thresholds, and attribution. See also [collaboration](../?path=/docs/patterns-collaboration--docs).

### Machine-assisted localisation

Bot-generated translations (with human review). Quality varies by language pair and domain. See also [generated content](../?path=/docs/patterns-generated-content--docs).

## Accessibility

- `lang` attributes on elements signal language to screen readers, enabling correct pronunciation and hyphenation
- RTL/LTR is both a localisation and accessibility concern
- Translation quality directly affects plain language thresholds — a well-written English interface can become inaccessible in a poorly translated locale
