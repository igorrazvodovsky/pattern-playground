# Suggestion

Intelligent systems can help actors by suggesting an action or data connection.

## Input assistance

{/* Detect: As a user, I need to see which values were suggested by the system. */}
{/* Explain: As a user, I want to understand the reasoning behind the system recommendation. */}
{/* Compare: As a user, I need to be able to compare existing human input with the system recommendation. */}
{/* Act: As user, I want to accept or reject system recommendations. */}

### Conversation

Clues for what's possible and what to do next.

{/* **Example:** In a chat interface, when a user types "I need help with", the system might suggest completing phrases like "booking a meeting", "resetting my password", or "accessing my account". */}

### Form

Auto-completion and smart defaults reduce cognitive load and prevent errors.

{/* **Example:** An address form that suggests postal codes based on the entered city, or a date picker that highlights recommended appointment slots based on availability. */}

#### Form element

Individual form fields can provide contextual suggestions as users interact with them.

{/* **Example:** A search field that shows recent searches, popular queries, or filtered suggestions based on the current input. */}

## Suggesting relationships

The system can identify and propose connections between data points that users might not have considered.

{/* **Example:** When viewing a customer record, the system suggests "People you may also want to contact" based on shared projects, departments, or interaction history. */}

## Proposing solutions

Intelligent recommendations for actions or workflows based on current context and user patterns.

{/* **Example:** After a user reports a bug, the system suggests relevant documentation, similar resolved issues, or the most appropriate team member to assign the ticket to. */}

## Certainty

Suggestions should communicate their confidence level to help users make informed decisions.

{/* **Example:** A recommendation engine shows "95% match" for highly confident suggestions, "Possible match" for moderate confidence, and "You might also like" for exploratory suggestions. */}

## Adjustment

Users should be able to refine or modify suggestions to better match their needs.

{/* **Example:** A calendar scheduling assistant suggests meeting times, but allows users to specify preferences like "only mornings" or "avoid Fridays" to improve future recommendations. */}

## Dismission and override

Users must have clear paths to reject suggestions and provide alternative input.

{/* **Example:** Autocomplete suggestions include an "Ã—" button to dismiss individual suggestions, and users can type past suggestions to enter custom values. */}
