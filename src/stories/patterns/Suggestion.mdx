# Suggestion

Intelligent systems can help actors by suggesting an action or data connection.

## Input assistance

{/* Detect: As a user, I need to see which values were suggested by the system. */}
{/* Explain: As a user, I want to understand the reasoning behind the system recommendation. */}
{/* Compare: As a user, I need to be able to compare existing human input with the system recommendation. */}
{/* Act: As user, I want to accept or reject system recommendations. */}

### Conversation

Clues for what's possible and what to do next.

{/* **Example:** In a chat interface, when a user types "I need help with", the system might suggest completing phrases like "booking a meeting", "resetting my password", or "accessing my account". */}

### Form

Auto-completion and smart defaults reduce cognitive load and prevent errors.

{/* **Example:** An address form that suggests postal codes based on the entered city, or a date picker that highlights recommended appointment slots based on availability. */}

#### Form element

Individual form fields can provide contextual suggestions as users interact with them.

{/* **Example:** A search field that shows recent searches, popular queries, or filtered suggestions based on the current input. */}

## Suggesting relationships

The system can identify and propose connections between data points that users might not have considered.

{/* **Example:** When viewing a customer record, the system suggests "People you may also want to contact" based on shared projects, departments, or interaction history. */}

## Proposing solutions

Intelligent recommendations for actions or workflows based on current context and user patterns.

{/* **Example:** After a user reports a bug, the system suggests relevant documentation, similar resolved issues, or the most appropriate team member to assign the ticket to. */}

## Certainty

Suggestions should communicate their confidence level to help users make informed decisions.

{/* **Example:** A recommendation engine shows "95% match" for highly confident suggestions, "Possible match" for moderate confidence, and "You might also like" for exploratory suggestions. */}

## Adjustment

Users should be able to refine or modify suggestions to better match their needs.

{/* **Example:** A calendar scheduling assistant suggests meeting times, but allows users to specify preferences like "only mornings" or "avoid Fridays" to improve future recommendations. */}

## Limitations

### Fixation risk

Providing explicit suggestions can constrain creative exploration through fixation effects:

- Users anchor to AI-generated examples rather than exploring alternatives
- Ideas homogenise as multiple users converge on similar AI-suggested approaches
- Diversity decreases even when users generate initial ideas before seeing suggestions
- Lower elaboration depth compared to question-driven approaches (65% minor elaboration, 25% no elaboration in suggestion-based dialogue vs 55% substantive elaboration in question-driven)

Research shows suggestion-based dialogue reduces both individual creativity and collective diversity (Maier et al. 2025). The effect occurs because concrete examples limit the solution space users consider, even when suggestions are high quality.

**Mitigation strategies:**
- Use question-driven scaffolding or ambiguous analogies that leave interpretive space for human creativity rather than concrete examples
- Delay suggestions until after initial ideation to reduce anchoring
- Present suggestions as inspiration rather than recommendations
- Provide diverse suggestion sets from different conceptual domains
- Consider whether the task benefits more from exploration (use questions) or optimisation (use suggestions)

See [Conversation](../?path=/docs/patterns-conversation--docs) dialogue forms for alternative interaction patterns that preserve diversity and elaboration depth.

## Dismission and override

Users must have clear paths to reject suggestions and provide alternative input.

{/* **Example:** Autocomplete suggestions include an "×" button to dismiss individual suggestions, and users can type past suggestions to enter custom values. */}
