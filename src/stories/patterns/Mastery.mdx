# Mastery

While [onboarding](../?path=/docs/patterns-onboarding--docs) focuses on *initial* [learning](../?path=/docs/foundations-learnability--docs), mastery focuses on *extended* learnability—building proficiency for the subset of users who become experts.

Most users remain *perpetual intermediates*—comfortable and productive without seeking mastery.
Design for mastery by providing optional paths to expertise without forcing all users through them.

## Accelerators
Mechanisms to bypass slower interfaces and act directly.
- *Keyboard shortcuts:* Require memorisation; primarily adopted by experts
- *Command menus:* Bridge between graphical and command-line interfaces; accessible to intermediates
- *Gestures:* Swipe, pinch, drag-and-drop for direct manipulation

## Customisation
Allow users to shape the tool around their workflow. See [malleability](../?path=/docs/foundations-malleability--docs) for the underlying framework.
- *Layout control:* Rearrange panels, hide unused tools, save workspace configurations
- *Automation:* Macros, scripts, or recorded actions for repetitive tasks

## Depth

Accelerators help users do things *faster*. Depth helps users understand things *better*—optional paths to deeper domain understanding for those who want it.

- *Domain exposure:* Reveal the concepts behind interface elements—why this workflow exists, what this data structure represents
- *Consequence visibility:* Show downstream effects of actions in domain terms, not just system terms
- *Pattern recognition:* Help users see recurring domain structures across the system

Unlike accelerators (which save time), depth mechanisms *invest* time for understanding. They should be clearly optional—most perpetual intermediates plateau productively without them.

This is extended [domain learnability](../?path=/docs/foundations-learnability--docs)—helping users who want to understand the domain more deeply through continued use of the tool.

## Retention

Retention mechanisms address the forgetting curve for infrequently-used but important procedures.

- *Contextual reminders:* "Last time you did X, you chose Y because..."
- *Spaced re-exposure:* Gradually surface advanced features as foundations solidify
- *Decision echoes:* Show past decisions when users return to complex areas


{/* ## Variants */}

{/* ### Progressive disclosure (reversed) */}
{/* Reveal complexity hidden from beginners. */}
{/* - Advanced settings: Expose raw parameters, configuration files, or debugging information */}
{/* - Expert modes: Toggle between simplified and full-featured interfaces */}

{/* ### Paradigm switching */}
{/* Switch between fundamentally different interaction models. */}
{/* - Example: WYSIWYG editor ↔ markdown source view */}
{/* - Example: Visual builder ↔ code editor */}
