# Mastery

While [onboarding](../?path=/docs/patterns-onboarding--docs) focuses on learning the tool, mastery focuses on building proficiency for the small subset of users who become experts.

Most users remain [perpetual intermediates](https://flylib.com/books/en/2.153.1.25/1/)—comfortable and productive without seeking mastery. Design for mastery by providing optional paths to expertise without forcing all users through them.

## Accelerators
Mechanisms to bypass slower interfaces and act directly.
- *Keyboard shortcuts:* Require memorisation; primarily adopted by experts
- *Command menus:* Bridge between graphical and command-line interfaces; accessible to intermediates
- *Gestures:* Swipe, pinch, drag-and-drop for direct manipulation

## Customisation
Allow users to shape the tool around their workflow.
- *Layout control:* Rearrange panels, hide unused tools, save workspace configurations
- *Automation:* Macros, scripts, or recorded actions for repetitive tasks

{/* ## Variants */}

{/* ### Progressive disclosure (reversed) */}
{/* Reveal complexity hidden from beginners. */}
{/* - Advanced settings: Expose raw parameters, configuration files, or debugging information */}
{/* - Expert modes: Toggle between simplified and full-featured interfaces */}

{/* ### Paradigm switching */}
{/* Switch between fundamentally different interaction models. */}
{/* - Example: WYSIWYG editor ↔ markdown source view */}
{/* - Example: Visual builder ↔ code editor */}
