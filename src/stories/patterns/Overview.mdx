# Patterns

Best practice design solutions for specific actor needs.


## First contact

The moments when someone encounters the system for the first time, or discovers something new. These patterns resolve the tension between welcoming unfamiliarity and preventing overwhelm.

- [Onboarding](../?path=/docs/patterns-onboarding--docs) - first-time experience establishing mental models
- [Progressive disclosure](../?path=/docs/patterns-progressivedisclosure--docs) - revealing complexity gradually as needed
- [Explanation](../?path=/docs/patterns-explanation--docs) - clarifying system behaviour and decisions

*Creates the context for understanding what's possible, leading naturally into dialogue initiation.*

## Initiating dialogue

Starting conversations with intelligent systems. These patterns address the challenge of expressing fuzzy intent to systems that need structured input.

- [Bot](../?path=/docs/patterns-bot--docs) - the conversational partner mediating between intent and action
- [Prompt](../?path=/docs/patterns-prompt-prompt--docs) - expressing what you want the bot to do
- [Suggestion](../?path=/docs/patterns-suggestion--docs) - system offers starting points and possibilities
- [AI tuning](../?path=/docs/patterns-aituning--docs) - configuring bot behaviour and preferences

*Establishes the conversational foundation, enabling the sustained exchanges that follow.*

## Active exchange

The core interaction unfolds through sustained dialogue. These patterns balance system intelligence with user control, transparency with fluency.

- [Conversation](../?path=/docs/patterns-conversation--docs) - sustained back-and-forth dialogue
- [Messaging](../?path=/docs/compositions-messaging--docs) - where conversation actually happens
- [Generated content](../?path=/docs/patterns-generatedcontent--docs) - what the bot produces
- [Transparent reasoning](../?path=/docs/patterns-transparentreasoning--docs) - making the bot's thinking visible
- [Annotation](../?path=/docs/patterns-annotation--docs) - adding layers of meaning to content

*The main workspace where ideas develop, creating artifacts that may need collaborative refinement.*

## Collaborative creation

Multiple actors coordinate their efforts. These patterns resolve tensions between individual agency and group alignment, visibility and noise, real-time and asynchronous work.

- [Collaboration](../?path=/docs/patterns-collaboration--docs) - coordination framework for shared work
- [Activity log](../?path=/docs/patterns-activitylog--docs) - chronological record of who did what
- [Notification](../?path=/docs/patterns-notification--docs) - keeping everyone appropriately informed
- [Commenting](../?path=/docs/compositions-commenting--docs) - discussion around artifacts

*Shared creation produces changes that need to be managed and persisted.*

## Managing outcomes

Handling the results of interaction. These patterns address the fundamental tension between committing changes and maintaining safety, between action and reversibility.

### Data operations
- [Saving](../?path=/docs/patterns-data-ops-saving--docs) - committing changes with appropriate friction
- [Deletion](../?path=/docs/patterns-data-ops-deletion--docs) - controlled removal with safeguards
- [Action consequences](../?path=/docs/patterns-data-ops-actionconsequences--docs) - understanding impact before committing
- [Undo](../?path=/docs/patterns-undo--docs) - reversing actions when needed

### Feedback and awareness
- [Status feedback](../?path=/docs/patterns-statusfeedback--docs) - communicating system state and results
- [Notification](../?path=/docs/patterns-notification--docs) - alerting to events requiring attention

*Proper outcome management enables confident exploration, feeding back into continued dialogue.*

## Specialized contexts

Domain-specific patterns for particular interaction needs. These emerge when the general patterns need tailoring for specific use cases.

- [Command menu](../?path=/docs/patterns-commandmenu-commandmenu--docs) - quick access to actions and navigation
- [Focus and context](../?path=/docs/patterns-focusandcontext-focusandcontext--docs) - balancing detail and overview
- [Living document](../?path=/docs/patterns-livingdocument--docs) - documents that evolve through use
- [Embedded intelligence](../?path=/docs/patterns-embeddedintelligence--docs) - AI capabilities woven into workflows
- [Text lense](../?path=/docs/patterns-textlense--docs) - dynamic content transformation

## States

Patterns addressing specific system states that cut across interaction stages.

- [Empty](../?path=/docs/patterns-states-stateempty--docs) - guiding actors when nothing exists yet
- [Disabled](../?path=/docs/patterns-states-statedisabled--docs) - communicating unavailable options
- [Unavailable actions](../?path=/docs/patterns-states-unavailableactions--docs) - explaining why actions aren't possible
