# Status feedback

A system should always keep users informed, by providing appropriate feedback. The "appropriate" way to communicate system status varies depending on several key factors:

- The *type* of information being communicated
- The *urgency* of the information — how important it is that the user sees it immediately
- The necessity to take *action* as an effect of the information

Three common approaches for status communication: validation, notification, and status indication.

## Indication

An indicator is a way of making an element stand out to inform the user that there is something special about it that warrants the user’s attention. Ways to do it include: typographic variations (e.g. making something bold, or changing its colour or size), using icons, and animations.

## Validation

Validation is the process of verifying the data to ensure it meets certain criteria.

## Notification

Notifications alert the user of general occurrences within a system. Unlike validation, notifications are typically not directly tied to user input, but they usually inform the user of a change in the system state or of an event that may be of interest.
