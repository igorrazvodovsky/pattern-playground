# Annotation

Enables actors to add layers of meaning to existing content through marking, highlighting, and contextual enrichment. Annotation creates a meta-layer that preserves the original while enabling interpretation, collaboration, and knowledge construction without disrupting the primary experience.

*Wear*—accumulated traces of attention (read wear) and modification (edit wear) that make invisible cognitive processes visible and shareable.

## Forces

- Preservation vs modification: actors want to add insights without altering source material
- Individual vs shared understanding: personal interpretations need to coexist with collective meaning
- Temporal persistence: some annotations are ephemeral thoughts, others become permanent knowledge
- Context vs clutter: rich annotations risk overwhelming the original content

## [Temporal](../?path=/docs/qualities-temporality--docs) dimension

- Lifecycle: Annotations might begin as ephemeral *thoughts* (scratchpad), harden into *notes* (personal reference), and may eventually mature into *documentation* and shared knowledge.
- Rhythm: The act of annotating breaks the flow of consumption, creating a slower, reflective rhythm compared to rapid interaction.
- History: Aggregated annotations create a visual history of how content has been interpreted and valued over time.

{/* ### Power dynamics */}
{/* Annotation carries implicit authority—who can annotate, whose annotations are visible, and how annotations influence interpretation all reflect and reinforce power structures. Design must consider: */}
{/* - Annotation permissions and hierarchies */}
{/* - Moderation and removal rights */}
{/* - Attribution and ownership */}
{/* - Canonical vs alternative interpretations */}

## Variants

### By permanence (wear accumulation)
- Persistent annotations: become part of the content's permanent context—deep wear patterns
- Ephemeral annotations: temporary marks that fade or expire—light wear traces
- Versioned annotations: track changes over time while preserving history—wear archaeology

### By visibility (wear distribution)
- Private annotations: personal notes visible only to the author—individual wear patterns
- Shared annotations: collaborative layer visible to specific groups—social wear formation
- Public annotations: open commentary accessible to all viewers—collective wear trails

### By function
- Descriptive: adding context, definitions, or explanations
- Critical: questioning, challenging, or evaluating content
- Connective: linking to related concepts or references
- Generative: sparking new ideas or directions

## Annotation types

### Visual marking (read wear)
Simple emphasis without/little semantic content—highlighting or color-coding that shows where attention has been focused.

### Textual annotation (edit wear)
Adding written commentary, notes, or descriptions that provide additional context or interpretation—traces of cognitive processing and meaning construction.

### Semantic tagging
Applying structured metadata—labels, categories, or standardised markers that enable systematic organisation.

### Reference linking
Connecting annotated content to external sources, related materials, or supporting evidence.

### System-generated annotation
Automated markup showing confidence levels, data sources, or algorithmic decisions (e.g., uncertainty indicators in AI-generated content).

## States

### Clean slate
- No annotations exist yet
- Subtle affordances suggest annotation capability
- Original content remains unobstructed

### Active annotation
- Visible marks with clear attribution
- Annotation tools readily accessible
- Navigation between annotated sections

### Dense coverage
- Multiple overlapping annotations
- Filtering and layering controls become important
- Risk of obscuring original content

## Related patterns

### Precursors
- [Temporality](../?path=/docs/qualities-temporality--docs) – annotations are markers of time and wear.
- [Learnability](../?path=/docs/qualities-learnability--docs) – annotations provide the context needed for learning.

### Follow-ups
- [Collaboration](../?path=/docs/patterns-collaboration--docs) – shared annotations enable collaborative sense-making.
- [Conversation](../?path=/docs/patterns-conversation--docs) – annotations often initiate critical dialogue.
- [Commenting](../?path=/docs/compositions-commenting--docs) – extends static annotation into dynamic discussion.

### Complementary
- [Explanation](../?path=/docs/patterns-explanation--docs) – clarifies complex concepts, often via description.
- [Transparent reasoning](../?path=/docs/patterns-transparent-reasoning--docs) – system annotations that reveal decision logic.
- [Generated content](../?path=/docs/patterns-generated-content--docs) – system marks confidence and origin.
- [Reference](../?path=/docs/concepts-reference--docs) – citation and source tracking.
- [Tag](../?path=/docs/patterns-tag--docs) – semantic tagging for organisation.

### Tangentially related
- [Badge](../?path=/docs/primitives-badge--docs) – visual indicators used as status annotations.

### Behavioural connections
Per the [Intent & Interaction framework](../?path=/docs/foundations-intent-interaction--docs):
- Supports *sense-making & integration* phase through marking and organising insights
- Enables *sharing, feedback & iterative learning* through collaborative annotation
- Facilitates *evaluation & relevance construction* by highlighting key information
