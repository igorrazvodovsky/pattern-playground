# Annotation

Enables actors to add layers of meaning to existing content through marking, highlighting, and contextual enrichment. Annotation creates a meta-layer that preserves the original while enabling interpretation, collaboration, and knowledge construction without disrupting the primary experience.

## Forces

- Preservation vs modification: actors want to add insights without altering source material
- Individual vs shared understanding: personal interpretations need to coexist with collective meaning
- Temporal persistence: some annotations are ephemeral thoughts, others become permanent knowledge
- Context vs clutter: rich annotations risk overwhelming the original content

{/* ### Power dynamics */}
{/* Annotation carries implicit authorityâ€”who can annotate, whose annotations are visible, and how annotations influence interpretation all reflect and reinforce power structures. Design must consider: */}
{/* - Annotation permissions and hierarchies */}
{/* - Moderation and removal rights */}
{/* - Attribution and ownership */}
{/* - Canonical vs alternative interpretations */}

## Variants

### By permanence
- Persistent annotations: become part of the content's permanent context
- Ephemeral annotations: temporary marks that fade or expire
- Versioned annotations: track changes over time while preserving history

### By visibility
- Private annotations: personal notes visible only to the author
- Shared annotations: collaborative layer visible to specific groups
- Public annotations: open commentary accessible to all viewers

### By function
- Descriptive: adding context, definitions, or explanations
- Critical: questioning, challenging, or evaluating content
- Connective: linking to related concepts or references
- Generative: sparking new ideas or directions

## Annotation types

### Visual marking
Simple emphasis without/little semantic contentâ€”highlighting or color-coding.

### Textual annotation
Adding written commentary, notes, or descriptions that provide additional context or interpretation.

### Semantic tagging
Applying structured metadataâ€”labels, categories, or standardised markers that enable systematic organisation.

### Reference linking
Connecting annotated content to external sources, related materials, or supporting evidence.

### System-generated annotation
Automated markup showing confidence levels, data sources, or algorithmic decisions (e.g., uncertainty indicators in AI-generated content).

## States

### Clean slate
- No annotations exist yet
- Subtle affordances suggest annotation capability
- Original content remains unobstructed

### Active annotation
- Visible marks with clear attribution
- Annotation tools readily accessible
- Navigation between annotated sections

### Dense coverage
- Multiple overlapping annotations
- Filtering and layering controls become essential
- Risk of obscuring original content

- Supports *sense-making & integration* phase through marking and organising insights
- Enables *sharing, feedback & iterative learning* through collaborative annotation
- Facilitates *evaluation & relevance construction* by highlighting key information
