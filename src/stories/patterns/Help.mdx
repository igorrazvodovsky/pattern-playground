# Help

A [conversation](../?path=/docs/foundations-conversation--docs) channel for sensemaking. It allows users to recover context ("Where am I?"), acquire domain knowledge ("What does this mean?"), and bridge the gulf of execution ("How do I do this?").

> 💭 Help is primarily *pull-based* (user seeks understanding). When the system proactively offers to *do* things, that is [embedded intelligence](../?path=/docs/patterns-embedded-intelligence--docs).

## The spectrum

Help operates on a gradient effectively mirroring the user's depth of inquiry:

### Operational/interface
Addressing the "How".
- *Goal:* Overcome interface friction.
- *Mechanisms:* Tooltips, empty states, input hints.
- *Example:* "Enter date in YYYY-MM-DD format."

### Conceptual/domain
Addressing the "Why".
- *Goal:* Build mental models of the underlying system/business logic.
- *Mechanisms:* [Explanations](../?path=/docs/patterns-explanation--docs), deep-dive documentation, "Learn more" sidebars.
- *Example:* "Why is this option disabled? Because the fiscal year is closed."

### Agentic/conversation
Addressing the "What now".
- *Goal:* Collaborative problem solving.
- *Mechanisms:* Chat interfaces, [bots](../?path=/docs/patterns-bot--docs) that can answer natural language queries about the current context.
- *Example:* "I'm stuck. How do I approve this without a PO number?"

## Contextual availability

Effective help is *situated*. It exists broadly in the same space as the user's focus, rather than requiring a context switch to a separate "Help Center."

- Inline: Guidance embedded directly in the flow. E.g. input hints and empty states
- Just-in-time: Revealed on specific interaction. TODO: expand, examples

- *[Embedded intelligence](../?path=/docs/patterns-embedded-intelligence--docs)* – The proactive sibling to Help. If Help explains how to do X, Embedded Intelligence offers to do X for you.
- *[Learnability](../?path=/docs/foundations-learnability--docs)* – The goal of effective help is to support Learnability (both initial and extended).
- *[Explanation](../?path=/docs/patterns-explanation--docs)* – The core content unit of high-quality help.
- *[Annotation](../?path=/docs/patterns-annotation--docs)* – A mechanism for attaching help to specific elements.
- *[Conversation](../?path=/docs/foundations-conversation--docs)* – The broader context for help as a dialogic process.
