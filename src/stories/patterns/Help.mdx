# Help

Assistance provided at the point of need.

{/* ## Push vs. Pull */}
{/* - **Push revelations (Tutorials):** System interrupts to show information (often unwanted and ignored). */}
{/* - **Pull revelations (Contextual Help):** User signals intent or need, and system responds. **Prefer Pull over Push.** */}

## Contextual help
The best help provides assistance when and where it's needed, without requiring users to break flow to seek it out. Instead of forcing users to leave the UI to read documentation, bring relevant reference material into the view.
*Mechanism:* popovers, modals, expandable sections.

### Guided tours
Sequential screens or cards that introduce features and interface behaviours. Similar to a wizard, but informational rather than configurational — users advance by swiping or tapping through the sequence.

- Typically launch on first run or after major version updates
- Must include a skip button on each screen
- Final screen should offer a way to re-launch the tour

Variant: Video demonstrations — short, looping clips showing gestures or interactions (e.g., macOS trackpad settings).

### Overlays
A transparent annotation layer laid over the interface, with arrows and text pointing out key features. Best suited to simple apps where function isn't pedagogically evident.

- Launch on first run or major updates
- Include a means to re-launch (settings menu or help icon)
- One-shot: dismissed after viewing, unlike persistent contextual help

## Inline help
Textual guidance embedded directly in the form or flow.

- *Input hints:* Greyed text inside input fields that clears on focus. Provides brief directions or examples of expected input format.
- *Content area hints:* Verbose descriptions of how to get started/proceed.
- *Empty states:* Guidance on how to populate a blank view.
- *Instructions:* Critical info that must be visible from the start.

## Documentation
Standalone reference material when contextual and inline help are insufficient.
Can be deep-linked from contextual help into relevant documentation sections.

- [Learnability](../?path=/docs/foundations-learnability--docs) structures the system to be easier to understand
- [Onboarding](../?path=/docs/patterns-onboarding--docs) - Help is often remedial onboarding.
- [Progressive Disclosure](../?path=/docs/patterns-progressive-disclosure--docs) - Help can be revealed progressively (e.g., "More info" toggles).
- [Transparent Reasoning](../?path=/docs/patterns-transparent-reasoning--docs) - Explaining *why* something happened is the ultimate form of help.
