# Help

A [conversation](../?path=/docs/foundations-conversation--docs) channel for sensemaking. It allows users to recover context ("Where am I?"), acquire domain knowledge ("What does this mean?"), and bridge the gulf of execution ("How do I do this?").

> 💭 Help is primarily *pull-based* (user seeks understanding). When the system proactively offers to *do* things, that is [embedded intelligence](../?path=/docs/patterns-embedded-intelligence--docs).

## Why users seek help

### Do: How do I execute this task?

Users need to act but face interface friction. Help here is operational—tooltips, input hints, empty states, wizards. The goal is immediate unblocking, not deep understanding.

### Study: Why does this work this way?"

Users want to build mental models of the underlying system or domain logic. Help here is conceptual—[explanations](../?path=/docs/patterns-explanation--docs), documentation, "learn more" sidebars. Example: "Why is this option disabled? Because the fiscal year is closed."

### Locate: Where is X?

Users know something exists but can't find it. This cuts across depth levels—locating a button is operational, locating a policy definition is conceptual. Mechanisms include search, index, [command menu](../?path=/docs/patterns-command-menu--docs), and glossary.

### Recover: Something went wrong—now what?

Users encounter errors or get stuck. Recovery may require quick interface correction (operational) or deeper diagnostic understanding (conceptual). Often begins with [status feedback](../?path=/docs/patterns-status-feedback--docs) that signals the problem.
{/* Mechanisms include error messages, troubleshooting guides, and contextual suggestions.  */}
When recovery needs exceed what static content can provide, help shifts to *conversation*—[bots](../?path=/docs/patterns-bot--docs) or chat interfaces that can reason about the specific context.

## Subject matter

Each help request concerns either:

- *Interface*: How to operate the UI—where to click, what fields to fill, how to navigate. Help here addresses execution mechanics.
- *Domain*: Why the system works this way—business rules, data relationships, regulatory constraints. Help here builds mental models of the underlying logic.

The same purpose can require either. A user seeking to "Do" might need interface help ("Where's the export button?") or domain help ("What format meets compliance requirements?"). "Locate" cuts across both—finding a button is interface; finding a policy definition is domain.

## Contextual availability

Help effectiveness depends on *proximity to point of need*. The closer help is to where users encounter friction, the less cognitive overhead required to find and apply it.

- *Inline*: Guidance embedded directly in the flow—input hints, empty states, field-level validation messages.
- *Just-in-time*: Revealed on specific interaction—tooltips on hover, contextual panels on focus.

- [Embedded intelligence](../?path=/docs/patterns-embedded-intelligence--docs) – The proactive sibling to Help. If Help explains how to do X, Embedded Intelligence offers to do X for you.
- [Learnability](../?path=/docs/foundations-learnability--docs) – The goal of effective help is to support Learnability (both initial and extended).
- [Explanation](../?path=/docs/patterns-explanation--docs) – The core content unit of high-quality help.
- [Annotation](../?path=/docs/patterns-annotation--docs) – A mechanism for attaching help to specific elements.
- [Conversation](../?path=/docs/foundations-conversation--docs) – The broader context for help as a dialogic process.
- [Status feedback](../?path=/docs/patterns-status-feedback--docs) – Communicates system state; the "Recover" purpose often begins with status feedback.
