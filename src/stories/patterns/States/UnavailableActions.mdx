# Unavailable actions

Hide actions that are currently inaccessible or irrelevant to the actor.

## Examples

Context menus & toolbars: only displaying actions relevant to the current context rather than disabling irrelevant items.

Permission-based features: completely removing actions actors lack permissions for, rather than showing them disabled.

## Edge cases

Situation when actors need to understand the full range of potential actions to establish a clear mental model.

## Accessibility concerns

Removing UI elements entirely (e.g., changing layout structure) might negatively impact assistive technology.
