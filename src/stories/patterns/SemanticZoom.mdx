# Semantic zoom

Viewing data at different levels of abstraction:
- Zoom out: summarisation
- Zoom in: elaboration or expansion

## User control

With and without possibility to zoom in/out.

## Examples

### Interactive text transformation

The [Bubble menu](?path=/docs/components-bubble-menu--docs) pattern demonstrates semantic zoom through text selection and transformation.
Users can select text and use AI-powered tools to expand or condense content at granular levels.

- Combined with *citations*, summaries let you capture key takeaways from a long document and then go deeper into the content that are relevant to you
- Combined with *synthesis*, summaries can take multiple inputs such as an email thread and capture the main ideas
- Combined with *workflow*, summaries can be added automatically to specific objects
- Semantic shift: e.g. "make it assertive", "make it friendly", simplify, change tone, translate
- Progressive disclosure
- Citations and sources provide top-down links between abstraction levels.
