# Collaboration

Enables multiple actors to work together effectively (i.e. without confusion, duplication, or loss of individual accountability) within a shared environment to achieve common goals.

See [Collaboration](../?path=/docs/foundations-collaboration--docs) foundation for conceptual grounding.

## Variants

### Temporal

- Real-time collaboration: simultaneous participation with immediate feedback
- Asynchronous collaboration: time-shifted contributions with integrated workflows
- Near-synchronous collaboration: hybrid approach with delayed but frequent updates

### Participant types

- Human â†” Human
- Human â†” Bot

## Interaction stages

These stages describe the shared workflow actors move through when creating together, from initial perception to final evaluation.

1. Perceive: actors gather and interpret information to establish a shared understanding of the task context and goals.
2. Think: This stage encompasses the internal cognitive or computational processes where both human and AI formulate ideas, strategies, and potential solutions.
3. Express: Articulating and externalizing internally generated ideas or results. The clarity, relevance, and interpretability of expression are crucial for collaborator comprehension and subsequent action, influencing the perceived usefulness and agency of each participant.
4. Collaborate: The core interactive partnership, characterized by iterative exchanges aimed at refining ideas, resolving discrepancies. Involves turn-taking, negotiation, critique, modification, and coordinated responses. Effective collaboration requires mechanisms that foster mutual understanding, transparency regarding actions and reasoning, and well-designed communication protocols.
5. Build: Translating collaboratively refined concepts into tangible artifacts or implemented solutions. Contributions from earlier stages serve as foundational blocks, templates, or reference materials. Actors may work in parallel or sequentially.
6. Test: Evaluating the co-created output against initial goals or emergent criteria. Actors assess quality, functionality, and alignment with shared vision. Evaluation often involves providing feedback through various modalities (explicit adjustments, natural language corrections, ratings), which can loop back to earlier stages for iteration.

## Human â†” Human collaboration

### Real-time collaboration

Enables users to work together simultaneously, with immediate feedback and shared presence.

TODO: Live cursors, presence indicators, messaging, simultaneous editing

### Asynchronous collaboration

Allows users to contribute at their own pace, without needing to be online at the same time.

TODO: Commenting, annotations, notifications, activity log, version management

## Human â†” Bot

Human-AI collaboration unfolds through the interaction stages with shifting [agency patterns](../?path=/docs/foundations-agency--docs#spectrum), [distribution](../?path=/docs/foundations-agency--docs#distribution), and [control mechanisms](../?path=/docs/foundations-agency--docs#control-patterns).

### Perceive

Actors gather and interpret information to establish shared understanding of the task context and goals.
Actors formulate intent and provide input.

- Agency: typically *reactive*â€”bot responds to user input without independent initiative
- Distribution: *human-centric* locus with user providing initial direction and framing
- Control mechanisms: *guided input* structures user prompts and parameters; *context awareness* enables bot to leverage history and environment

### Think

Internal cognitive or computational processes where actors formulate ideas, strategies, and potential solutions.
This involves processing perceived input, generating novel representations, planning approaches, and evaluating possibilities.
The alignment (or misalignment) between collaborators' thinking critically impacts the trajectory of collaboration.

- Agency: *semi-active* to *proactive*â€”bot analyzes inputs and may generate insights or suggestions independently
- Distribution: shifting toward *shared* locus as bot contributes substantive thinking; *dynamic allocation* based on problem complexity
- Control mechanisms: *transparency* makes bot reasoning visible; *intervention* allows real-time adjustment; *context management* maintains task continuity

### Express

Articulating and externalizing generated ideas or results.
Actors manifest thoughts through various outputs: text, multimodal content, actions, or decisions.
The clarity, relevance, and interpretability of expression are crucial for collaborator comprehension and subsequent action, influencing the perceived usefulness and agency of each participant.

- Agency: *reactive* to *semi-active*â€”bot generates outputs in response to prompts or contextual triggers
- Distribution: varies by output type; may be *human-centric* (user directs generation) or *shared* (bot proposes options)
- Control mechanisms: *transparency* distinguishes AI-generated content; *adaptive scaffolding* adjusts output complexity; *modification* enables direct editing

### Collaborate

The core interactive partnership, characterized by iterative exchanges aimed at refining ideas and resolving discrepancies.
Involves turn-taking, negotiation, critique, modification, and coordinated responses.
Agency becomes highly distributed and dynamically negotiated during this stage.
Effective collaboration requires fostering mutual understanding and transparency regarding actions and reasoning.

- Agency: *co-operative*â€”bot acts as active partner, both actors mutually influence the creative output
- Distribution: *shared* locus with *dynamic allocation* as control shifts based on task phase; both *high-level* (strategic) and *fine-grained* (tactical) granularity
- Control mechanisms: full range appliesâ€”*iterative feedback loops* enable refinement; *intervention* allows course correction; *transparency* maintains shared understanding; *confidence visualization* surfaces reliability

### Build

Translating collaboratively refined concepts into tangible artifacts or implemented solutions.
Contributions from earlier stages serve as foundational blocks, templates, or reference materials.
Actors may work in parallel or sequentially, with agency pivoting towards execution, integration, and fine-grained control during materialization of the co-created vision.

- Agency: *proactive* to *co-operative*â€”bot may execute tasks autonomously or work alongside user
- Distribution: may shift between *human-centric*, *shared*, and *system-centric* based on sub-task; *fine-grained* control during implementation
- Control mechanisms: *intervention* enables real-time adjustments; *modification* allows direct editing of outputs; *adaptive scaffolding* adjusts assistance levels; *chain-of-thought* reveals execution reasoning

### Test

Evaluating the co-created output against initial goals or emergent criteria.
Actors assess quality, functionality, and alignment with shared vision.
Evaluation often involves providing feedback through various modalities (explicit adjustments, natural language, ratings, embodied reactions), which can loop back to earlier stages for iteration.

- Agency: *semi-active*â€”bot provides evaluation support and identifies issues, but doesn't make final judgments
- Distribution: *human-centric* locus for ultimate acceptance/rejection decisions; bot contributes analysis
- Control mechanisms: *confidence visualization* indicates bot's certainty about issues; *explanatory feedback* clarifies evaluation reasoning; *iterative feedback loops* enable refinement cycles; *intervention* allows override of bot assessments
