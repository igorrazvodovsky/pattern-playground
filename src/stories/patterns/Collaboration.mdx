# Collaboration

Enables multiple actors to work together effectively within a shared environment to achieve common goals.

## Variants

### Temporal

- Real-time collaboration: simultaneous participation with immediate feedback
- Asynchronous collaboration: time-shifted contributions with integrated workflows
- Near-synchronous collaboration: hybrid approach with delayed but frequent updates

### Participant types

- Human ↔ Human
- Human ↔ Bot

{/* ## Core components */}

{/* - Shared workspace: common environment accessible to all participants */}
{/* - Presence indicators: visual signals of active participants and their activities */}
{/* - Contribution tracking: attribution and versioning of individual inputs */}
{/* - Conflict resolution: handling competing or conflicting contributions */}
{/* - Communication channels: messaging, comments, or discussion tools */}
{/* - Oversight: ability to review, modify, or override contributions */}

## Human ↔ Human collaboration

### Real-time collaboration

Enables users to work together simultaneously, with immediate feedback and shared presence.

TODO: Live cursors, presence indicators, messaging, simultaneous editing

### Asynchronous collaboration

Allows users to contribute at their own pace, without needing to be online at the same time.

TODO: Commenting, annotations, notifications, activity log, version management

...

## Human ↔ Bot

### Dialogic collaboration

Turn-based interaction where meaning and direction emerge through iterative conversation.

TODO: Interaction patterns
- Recap rituals (“Here’s what we’ve covered…”)
- Prompt scaffolding (templates, few-shot examples)
- Clarification turns (“Did you mean…?”)
- Transparency prompts (“Because you said X, I suggested Y”)

### Adaptive collaboration?

### Core collaborative components
- [Activity log](../?path=/docs/patterns-activity-log--docs) - tracks chronological actions of all participants for transparency and accountability
- [Conversation](../?path=/docs/patterns-conversation--docs) - enables turn-taking and feedback mechanisms essential for collaborative communication
{/* - saving - handles conflict resolution and multi-user editing scenarios in shared workspaces */}

### Communication and awareness
- [Notification](../?path=/docs/patterns-notification--docs) - keeps collaborators informed of changes and events in shared environments
- [Explanation](../?path=/docs/patterns-explanation--docs) - facilitates understanding through transparency about other actors' actions
{/* - status feedback - provides awareness of system state and action effects */}

### Human-AI collaboration
- [Bot](../?path=/docs/patterns-bot--docs) - defines AI agents as collaborative participants with adaptable mediation capabilities
- [Transparent reasoning](../?path=/docs/patterns-transparent-reasoning--docs) - makes AI decision-making processes inspectable for human collaborators
