# Collaboration

Enables multiple actors to work together effectively (i.e. without confusion, duplication, or loss of individual accountability) within a shared environment to achieve common goals.

## Forces
- Visibility vs noise: people want to see what others are doing, but too much activity overwhelms.
- Flexibility vs consistency: some need freedom to experiment, others need order.
- Individual agency vs group alignment: people want to own their part but still converge on a shared result.

## Variants

### Temporal

- Real-time collaboration: simultaneous participation with immediate feedback
- Asynchronous collaboration: time-shifted contributions with integrated workflows
- Near-synchronous collaboration: hybrid approach with delayed but frequent updates

### Participant types

- Human â†” Human
- Human â†” Bot

## Interaction stages

These stages describe the shared workflow actors move through when creating together, from initial perception to final evaluation.

1. Perceive: actors gather and interpret information to establish a shared understanding of the task context and goals.
2. Think: This stage encompasses the internal cognitive or computational processes where both human and AI formulate ideas, strategies, and potential solutions.
3. Express: Articulating and externalizing internally generated ideas or results. The clarity, relevance, and interpretability of expression are crucial for collaborator comprehension and subsequent action, influencing the perceived usefulness and agency of each participant.
4. Collaborate: The core interactive partnership, characterized by iterative exchanges aimed at refining ideas, resolving discrepancies. Involves turn-taking, negotiation, critique, modification, and coordinated responses. Effective collaboration requires mechanisms that foster mutual understanding, transparency regarding actions and reasoning, and well-designed communication protocols.
5. Build: Translating collaboratively refined concepts into tangible artifacts or implemented solutions. Contributions from earlier stages serve as foundational blocks, templates, or reference materials. Actors may work in parallel or sequentially.
6. Test: Evaluating the co-created output against initial goals or emergent criteria. Actors assess quality, functionality, and alignment with shared vision. Evaluation often involves providing feedback through various modalities (explicit adjustments, natural language corrections, ratings), which can loop back to earlier stages for iteration.

{/* ## Core components */}

{/* - Shared workspace: common environment accessible to all participants */}
{/* - Presence indicators: visual signals of active participants and their activities */}
{/* - Contribution tracking: attribution and versioning of individual inputs */}
{/* - Conflict resolution: handling competing or conflicting contributions */}
{/* - Communication channels: messaging, comments, or discussion tools */}
{/* - Oversight: ability to review, modify, or override contributions */}

## Human â†” Human collaboration

### Real-time collaboration

Enables users to work together simultaneously, with immediate feedback and shared presence.

TODO: Live cursors, presence indicators, messaging, simultaneous editing

### Asynchronous collaboration

Allows users to contribute at their own pace, without needing to be online at the same time.

TODO: Commenting, annotations, notifications, activity log, version management

## Human â†” Bot

Human-AI collaboration involves navigating through the interaction stages with considerations for [agency distribution](../?path=/docs/foundations-agency--docs#distribution) and [control mechanisms](../?path=/docs/foundations-agency--docs#control-patterns). Bot agency follows the general [agency spectrum](../?path=/docs/foundations-agency--docs#spectrum), shifting dynamically across interaction stagesâ€”reactive during perceive, co-operative during collaborate, semi-active during test.

See [Bot](../?path=/docs/patterns-bot--docs) for detailed interaction patterns.
