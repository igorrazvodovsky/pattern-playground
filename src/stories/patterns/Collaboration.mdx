# Collaboration

Enables multiple actors to work together effectively (i.e. without confusion, duplication, or loss of individual accountability) within a shared environment to achieve common goals.

## Forces
- Visibility vs noise: people want to see what others are doing, but too much activity overwhelms.
- Flexibility vs consistency: some need freedom to experiment, others need order.
- Individual agency vs group alignment: people want to own their part but still converge on a shared result.

## Variants

### Temporal

- Real-time collaboration: simultaneous participation with immediate feedback
- Asynchronous collaboration: time-shifted contributions with integrated workflows
- Near-synchronous collaboration: hybrid approach with delayed but frequent updates

### Participant types

- Human ‚Üî Human
- Human ‚Üî Bot

{/* ## Core components */}

{/* - Shared workspace: common environment accessible to all participants */}
{/* - Presence indicators: visual signals of active participants and their activities */}
{/* - Contribution tracking: attribution and versioning of individual inputs */}
{/* - Conflict resolution: handling competing or conflicting contributions */}
{/* - Communication channels: messaging, comments, or discussion tools */}
{/* - Oversight: ability to review, modify, or override contributions */}

## Human ‚Üî Human collaboration

### Real-time collaboration

Enables users to work together simultaneously, with immediate feedback and shared presence.

TODO: Live cursors, presence indicators, messaging, simultaneous editing

### Asynchronous collaboration

Allows users to contribute at their own pace, without needing to be online at the same time.

TODO: Commenting, annotations, notifications, activity log, version management

...

## Human ‚Üî Bot

### Dialogic collaboration

Turn-based interaction where meaning and direction emerge through iterative conversation.

TODO: Interaction patterns
- Recap rituals (‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what we‚Äôve covered‚Ä¶‚Äù)
- Prompt scaffolding (templates, few-shot examples)
- Clarification turns (‚ÄúDid you mean‚Ä¶?‚Äù)
- Transparency prompts (‚ÄúBecause you said X, I suggested Y‚Äù)
