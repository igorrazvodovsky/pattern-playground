# Structured format

The structure of the control gives the user a clue about what kind of input is being requested.

- Rigid expectations: the format is familiar and well defined (e.g., credit card information, local telephone numbers, licence strings)
- No deviation expected: you don't expect any users to need to deviate from the format
- Error reduction: breaking data into chunks (2-5 characters) makes it easier to transcribe or memorise

{/* ## How it works */}
{/* 1. Multiple fields: design a set of text fields that visually reflect the format (e.g., `[___] - [__] - [____]`) */}
{/* 2. Field length: keep text fields short as a visual clue to the expected input length */}
{/* 3. Auto-advance: after the user fills a field, automatically move focus to the next one (confirming they entered the right amount of characters) */}
{/* 4. Use placeholder to clarify expected formats (e.g., "dd/mm/yyyy") */}

- [Input](../?path=/docs/primitives-input--docs) - the basic component
- [Forgiving format](../?path=/docs/patterns-data-entry-forgiving-format--docs) - best for open-ended input where valid formats vary; Structured Format is for very predictable formats
