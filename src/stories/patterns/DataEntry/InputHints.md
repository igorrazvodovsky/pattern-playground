# Input hints

A phrase or example that explains what is required or gives additional detail about what is being requested.

Hints can be provided in two ways:
- Helper text
- Placeholder text (if the control supports it)

_Precursors_
- [Input](../?path=/docs/primitives-input--docs) - the component being annotated
- [Annotation](../?path=/docs/patterns-annotation--docs) - the broader concept of adding helpful context

_Complementary_
- [Input prompt](../?path=/docs/patterns-data-entry-input-prompt--docs) - text _inside_ the field; hints sit _outside_
- [Forgiving format](../?path=/docs/patterns-data-entry-forgiving-format--docs) - if you can't hint the format, make the system accept any format
