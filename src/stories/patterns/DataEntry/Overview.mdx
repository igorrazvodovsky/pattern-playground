# Data entry

Patterns for inputting information into the system.
These resolve the tension between the messiness of human expression and the system's need for structure.
The goal is to capture user intent with minimal effort—frictionless by default.

- [Forgiving format](../?path=/docs/patterns-data-entry-forgiving-format--docs) - accepting diverse input formats and normalizing them
- [Structured format](../?path=/docs/patterns-data-entry-structured-format--docs) - guiding input into a strict format when ambiguity is dangerous
{/* - [Input hints](../?path=/docs/patterns-data-entry-input-hints--docs) - helping users maximize success before they type */}
{/* - [Input prompt](../?path=/docs/patterns-data-entry-input-prompt--docs) - clear instructions on what is expected */}
