# Focus and context

Displaying detailed information alongside a simplified or abstracted view of its context,
enabling users to maintain situational awareness while completing focused tasks.

## Examples

{/* <Story of={ SituationalStructure.Basic } /> */}

### Contextual navigation

The system uses domain knowledge to show how each part of an industrial pasteurizer fits into both
the production line and the overall process of making orange juice. There are three levels of context:
1. Explicitly defined connections: relationships directly referenced in the objectâ€™s data (e.g., parent-child relationships).
2. Inferred relationships: connections between existing objects that arenâ€™t explicitly defined but can be inferred by the LLM using domain knowledge.
3. Deduced relationships: relationships between defined objects and objects outside the system or potential, yet-to-be-defined objects (e.g., deducing a "Recirculation Pump" might exist if a "Heating Assembly" is present).

Big moments get the spotlight with plenty of detail, while the stuff in between gets summed up.
