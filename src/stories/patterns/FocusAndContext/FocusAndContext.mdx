# Focus and context

Displaying detailed information alongside a simplified or abstracted view of its context,
enabling users to maintain situational awareness while completing focused tasks.

## Examples

{/* <Story of={ SituationalStructure.Basic } /> */}

### Contextual navigation

Contextual navigation helps users understand the industrial pasteuriser's structure&nbsp;â€“ where each component fits
within the pasteuriser itself, the production line, and the broader orange juice process.
Navigation maps out three types of relationships:
1. **Explicit** connections are clearly defined in the dataâ€”like parent-child structures or functional groupings.
2. **Inferred** connections aren't directly stated but can be identified using domain knowledgeâ€”such as parts that consistently appear together in certain setups.
3. **Deduced** connections suggest components that aren't yet modeled but are likely needed based on what's already present. If there's a "Heating Assembly," for example, a "Recirculation Pump" might reasonably be expected.
