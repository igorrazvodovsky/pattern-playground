# Focus and context

Displaying detailed information alongside a simplified or abstracted view of its context,
enabling users to maintain situational awareness while completing focused tasks.

## Examples

{/* <Story of={ SituationalStructure.Basic } /> */}

### Contextual navigation

Contextual navigation helps users understand the industrial pasteuriser's structure&nbsp;– where each component fits
within the pasteuriser itself, the production line, and the broader orange juice process.
Navigation maps out three types of relationships:
1. **Explicit** connections are clearly defined in the data—like parent-child structures or functional groupings.
2. **Inferred** connections aren't directly stated but can be identified using domain knowledge—such as parts that consistently appear together in certain setups.
3. **Deduced** connections suggest components that aren't yet modeled but are likely needed based on what's already present. If there's a "Heating Assembly," for example, a "Recirculation Pump" might reasonably be expected.

* Has [agency](../?path=/docs/qualities-agency--docs) to
  * Edit layouts, suggest actions, create drafts, etc.
  * Act as an intelligent mediator between the user and complex information landscapes
  * Take initiative to highlight information that may be relevant but not yet in focus
  * Make autonomous decisions about what contextual information to prioritise
  * Serve as a partner in navigating information rather than a passive display system
* [Adapts](../?path=/docs/qualities-adaptability--docs)
  * To dynamically recalibrate the information hierarchy as tasks or goals evolve
  * Respond to changing conditions in the information environment
  * Predict potential next focus areas based on current attention patterns
  * Balance information [density](./?path=/docs/qualities-density--docs) based on user cognitive load and task complexity
  * Synthesise new contextual frames that weren't explicitly designed but are relevant
* Can be combined with [progressive disclosure](../?path=/docs/patterns-progressive-disclosure--docs)
{/* * Can be paired with *text lens* with the latter playing the role of a starting point. */}
