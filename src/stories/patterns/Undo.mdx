# Undo

Enables actors to reverse an action, providing confidence and reducing anxiety around exploration or mistakes.

## Structure

- Trigger
- Feedback
- Scope

## Levels: single-action vs. multiple levels of undo
Whether undo can be applied only once or successively.

## Linear vs. non-linear undo

- Single-action undo: Reverses only the most recent action.
- Multi-action undo: Allows reversing multiple actions sequentially.

- Selective undo: Allows to pick a specific action from a history to undo, without affecting subsequent actions.
- Regional undo: Enables undoing operations within specific regions or contexts
- Branching models: Creates tree-like structures where actors can explore alternative paths

## Collaboration

TODO:

{/* Redo */}
{/* Causal dependence: Redo requires an undo to have been performed. */}
