# Collaboration

Enables multiple actors to work together effectively within a shared environment to achieve common goals.

## Variants

### Temporal

- Real-time collaboration: simultaneous participation with immediate feedback
- Asynchronous collaboration: time-shifted contributions with integrated workflows
- Near-synchronous collaboration: hybrid approach with delayed but frequent updates

### Participant types

- Human ↔ Human
- Human ↔ Bot

## Core components

- Shared workspace: common environment accessible to all participants
- Presence indicators: visual signals of active participants and their activities
- Contribution tracking: attribution and versioning of individual inputs
- Conflict resolution: handling competing or conflicting contributions
- Communication channels: messaging, comments, or discussion tools
- Oversight: ability to review, modify, or override contributions

## Human ↔ Human collaboration

### Real-time collaboration

Enables users to work together simultaneously, with immediate feedback and shared presence.

TODO: Live cursors, presence indicators, messaging, simultaneous editing

### Asynchronous collaboration

Allows users to contribute at their own pace, without needing to be online at the same time.

TODO: Commenting, annotations, notifications, activity log, version management

...

## Human ↔ Bot

### Dialogic collaboration

Turn-based interaction where meaning and direction emerge through iterative conversation.

TODO: Interaction patterns
- Recap rituals (“Here’s what we’ve covered…”)
- Prompt scaffolding (templates, few-shot examples)
- Clarification turns (“Did you mean…?”)
- Transparency prompts (“Because you said X, I suggested Y”)
