> ðŸ™‚ **Fun meter: 4/5**. A part of a bigger attempt to map LLM-related patterns.
Here I'm separating a 'chatbot' into 'chat' & 'bot' because 'bot' can use other means to communicate.
For now I stick with â€˜botâ€™ over â€˜agentâ€™ or â€˜assistantâ€™ because those tend to carry baggage about capabilities and autonomy.

# Bot

## Tool use

...

## Collaborative interaction

### Reflective prompting

Context-aware completions and reflective questions based on interaction patterns to streamline prompt creation.

### Input-output mapping

Visually displaying how specific parts of the user's input corresponded to the LLM's output, and includes a confidence indicator
to highlight lower-confidence sections.

{/* ## Functional flexibility */}

### Confidence mapping

Integrated with *input-output mapping*, it's aimed to increase transparency by indicating the model's confidence in different parts of its response.
