For now I stick with â€˜botâ€™ over â€˜agentâ€™ or â€˜assistantâ€™ because those tend to carry baggage about capabilities and autonomy.

# Bot

A bot interprets actor intent and returns relevant outputâ€”text, UI, or actions. It acts as an adaptable mediator between actor goals and system functionality, especially when intent is fuzzy or workflows are complex.

## Modes of interaction

### Focused

Bot as a primary interface, typically via [messaging](../?path=/docs/compositions-messaging--docs).

### Inline

Contextual interactions embedded directly in the UI, such as autocompletions, rewrite suggestions, or smart defaults.

### Ambient

Behind-the-scenes monitoring or support, offering proactive help or taking actions without direct prompting.

## Tool use

...

## Functional flexibility

TODO: botâ€™s ability to support a range of tasks or workflows

### Confidence mapping

Integrated with *input-output mapping*, it's aimed to increase transparency by indicating the bot/model's confidence in different parts of its response.

### Precursors
{/* Primarily establish clear expectations, prepare mental models, and facilitate effective input to enhance subsequent bot interactions. */}

<div>
- [Agency](../?path=/docs/foundations-agency--docs) - how much freedom the bot has to act on its own.
- [Onboarding](../?path=/docs/patterns-onboarding--docs), priming, and [suggestions](../?path=/docs/patterns-suggestion--docs) are the first steps that help people get to know the botâ€”what it can and can't do, and how to get the most out of it.
- [Progressive disclosure](../?path=/docs/patterns-progressive-disclosure--docs) â€“ bots often operate well with incremental complexity. Progressive disclosure keeps things simple at first and helps actors build confidence.
</div>

### Follow-ups

- Bot can use [messaging](../?path=/docs/compositions-messaging--docs) to [converse](../?path=/docs/patterns-conversation--docs) with actors.
- [Prompt](../?path=/docs/patterns-prompt--docs) describes ways of providing input to the bot.
- LLM [settings](../?path=/docs/patterns-intelligence-llm-settings--docs) help keep users in control while the bot does its thing.
- [Generated content](../?path=/docs/patterns-generated-content--docs) - presentation and manipulation of AI's output.
- [Transparent reasoning](../?path=/docs/patterns-transparent-reasoning--docs) makes bot's decision-making process visible and inspectable.
- [Activity log](../?path=/docs/patterns-activity-log--docs) tracks bot actions and reasoning for transparency and review.
- [Collaboration](../?path=/docs/patterns-collaboration--docs) - Bots participate as collaborative agents with adaptable mediation capabilities
