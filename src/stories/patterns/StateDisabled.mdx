# Disabled state

**Stuff to avoid**. Disabled states are commonly used to indicate unavailable features or
functions. However, this often lead to confusion and frustration. In most cases,
an alternative leads to a better experience.

## The problem

### Confusion and frustration

User may not understand why they can't interact with a certain element and may struggle to figure out how to enable it. This can lead to a frustrating user experience.

### Accessibility issues

Disabled states often use lower opacity or light gray colors, making them hard to see for people with visual impairments. Theyâ€™re also usually not reachable by keyboard.

## Alternatives and related patterns

### Enable and [explain](./?path=/docs/patterns-explanation--docs)

Keep the UI element enabled. Then, upon user interaction, explain why the action can't currently be performed.

### [Unavailable actions](./?path=/docs/patterns-unavailable-actions--docs)

Hide elements that are not relevant in the current context.

### Form validation

Instead of disabling the submit button until everythingâ€™s filled out perfectly,
let people click it anytime and check the form afterward.
If somethingâ€™s missing or wrong, show clear tips to help them fix it.
