# Text lens

Applying different lenses to view and modify text content. Actors can switch between different perspectives to transform how content is presented:

**Magnifying lens:** Adjust detail level
- Zoom out: summarisation
- Zoom in: elaboration or expansion

**Filter lens:** Shift tone and style
- Formal â†” casual
- Technical â†” accessible
- Assertive â†” diplomatic

## User control

Text lenses can be applied with varying degrees of user control:
- Direct control: Users explicitly select and apply specific lens types
- Contextual suggestions: System recommends appropriate lenses based on content or context
- Automatic application: Lenses applied based on user preferences or situational needs

## Examples

### Interactive text transformation

The [Bubble menu](../?path=/docs/components-bubble-menu--docs) pattern demonstrates text lens application through text selection and transformation.
Users can select text and apply different lenses using AI-powered tools to modify content presentation at granular levels.
