# Unavailable actions

Hide actions that are currently inaccessible or irrelevant to the actor.

## Examples

Context menus & toolbars: only displaying actions relevant to the current context rather than disabling irrelevant items.

Permission-based features: completely removing actions actors lack permissions for, rather than showing them disabled.

## Edge cases

Situation when actors need to understand the full range of potential actions to establish a clear mental model.

## Accessibility concerns

Removing UI elements entirely (e.g., changing layout structure) might negatively impact assistive technology.

- Hiding options is an alternative to [disabled state](./?path=/docs/patterns-states-disabled-state--docs)
- [Morphing controls](./?path=/docs/patterns-states-morphing-controls--docs) — keeps the control visible but transforms it
- [Progressive disclosure](../?path=/docs/patterns-progressive-disclosure--docs) — a softer form: deferring rather than removing
- [Toolbar](../?path=/docs/compositions-toolbar--docs) — primary context where actions are hidden based on selection or state
- [Command menu](../?path=/docs/patterns-command-menu--docs) — context menus apply the same principle, surfacing only relevant commands
