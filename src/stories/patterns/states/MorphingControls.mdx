# Morphing controls

A control that transforms its appearance and available actions in response to a state change, replacing the previous set of options with those relevant to the new mode.

## When to use

Use morphing controls when the completion of that action makes the original trigger meaningless. The control communicates the current state while offering the most logical next step.

Avoid when users need to see the full range of possible actions to build a mental model, or when the transition between states is ambiguous and requires explanation.

## Examples

### Toggle

<Story of={MorphingControlsStories.FollowUnfollow} />

### Multi-state close

Close with confirmation is a common pattern, but instead of a separate dialog, the control itself morphs to offer the confirm action. This keeps the user in context and reduces friction.
