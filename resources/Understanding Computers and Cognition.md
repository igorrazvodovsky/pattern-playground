"Understanding computers and cognition" by Terry Winograd and Fernando Flores

# Design principles
- Design for situated action: Accept that real use will diverge from formal plans; systems should flex and adapt.
- Support conversations for action: Enable users to request, promise, negotiate, and confirm in ways that reflect real organisational life.
- Respect tacit knowledge: Don’t over-formalise workflows; leave space for improvisation and judgement.

# From information to interpretation
Meaning arises in human interpretation, not in data itself.
Design implication: Always ask “Who is interpreting this output, and in what context?”

# From problem-solving to language and action
Human activity is embedded in conversations, commitments, and social interactions. Systems must support these actions, not just abstract “problem-solving.”
Design implication: Focus on supporting coordination, agreements, and shared understanding, not just task completion.

# From representation to breakdowns
Breakdowns (errors, surprises, interruptions) reveal the limits of a system and open new possibilities for action.
Design implication: Treat breakdowns as design opportunities and plan for graceful handling, not just prevention.

# Speech act theory
Communication isn’t just about information; it performs actions (e.g., requests, promises, declarations).
Application: Analyse interactions as commitments (Who owes what to whom?) and design UIs that make these visible/manageable.

# Structural coupling
Humans and technology evolve together through interaction.
Application: Evaluate systems not only by immediate usability but also by how they change practices over time.

# Integrations

- With user-centred design: Adds a focus on language, commitments, and tacit practices beyond observable tasks.
- With service design: Complements journey mapping by emphasising conversations and breakdowns as key moments.
- With AI: Highlights the importance of interpretation, context, and breakdowns—crucial when systems “hallucinate” or output ambiguous results.

# Practical methods
- Conversation mapping: Chart interactions as speech acts (requests, promises, declarations). Helps reveal where commitments break down.
- Breakdown diaries: Ask users to record moments when the system surprised or failed them. Analyse not just causes, but new practices that emerged.
- Commitment tracking: Prototype interfaces that show open commitments, who’s responsible, and what state they’re in.

# Questions

- What tacit practices shape how this system will actually be used?
- What conversations and commitments does this design support or constrain?
- How will breakdowns appear, and how can the system help users recover?
- In what ways will this system change practices over time?
- Where might interpretation diverge, and how will we surface that divergence?
