## Core Framework

The paper proposes an integrated framework analyzing human-AI co-creation through **five dimensions**:

1. **Context** (interaction stage + modality)
2. **Patterns & Distribution of Agency**
3. **Control Mechanisms** (input, action, output, feedback)
4. **Application Domains**
5. **Challenges & Directions**

---

## Key Definitions

### Human-AI Co-creation
The activity where AI assists humans through dynamic partnership, leveraging AI creativity to complete creative works with each contributing unique efforts.

### Agency (HCI/CSCW Perspective)
- **Human agency**: Intentional initiation of action and subjective experience of directing outcomes
- **Machine agency**: Capacity of machines to act autonomously and interact with users/environments
- **Control**: Operational mechanisms, commands, and manipulations to execute intentions

**Critical distinction**: Agency = *high-level goal-directed guidance*; Control = *specific means of execution*

---

## Interaction Stages (Section 4.1)

Based on Wu et al. [194], adopted by Zhang et al. [200]:

1. **Perceive**: Gather/interpret information for shared understanding (textual, visual, audio, embodied inputs)
2. **Think**: Internal cognitive/computational processes to formulate ideas and strategies
3. **Express**: Articulate and externalize generated ideas (text, images, sounds, multimodal, actions)
4. **Collaborate**: Iterative exchanges, turn-taking, negotiation, critique, refinement
5. **Build**: Translate concepts into tangible artifacts (construction, implementation)
6. **Test**: Evaluate output against goals; provide feedback for iteration

## Agency Patterns Spectrum (Section 5.1)

**Distribution from 106 papers with system implementations**:

| Pattern | Count | Description | Key Characteristic |
|---------|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Passive** | 18 | Acts only upon direct invocation | AI's subtle influence on dynamics |
| **Reactive** | 34 | Responds to user input/actions | Direct response, no independent initiative |
| **Semi-active** | 12 | Initiates under specific conditions | Contextual support when triggered |
| **Proactive** | 9 | Takes independent initiative | Introduces unique insights early |
| **Co-operative** | 33 | Collaborates alongside user | Acting as equal partner |

**Key insight**: Co-operative (31.1%) and Reactive (32.1%) dominate current implementations.

## Agency Distribution Dimensions (Section 5.2)

Extends Holter et al. [68] with three orthogonal dimensions:

### 1. Locus
Where primary decision-making authority resides:
- **Human-centric**: Human retains ultimate authority, AI assists
- **Shared**: Authority distributed as collaborators
- **System-centric**: AI executes autonomously within human-defined parameters

### 2. Dynamics
How authority is managed over time:
- **Static allocation**: Predefined roles set during design
- **Dynamic allocation**: Control shifts situationally based on context

### 3. Granularity
Level of detail at which authority is exercised:
- **High-level**: Strategic goals, overall workflow direction
- **Fine-grained**: Specific actions, parameter adjustments within processes

## Control Mechanisms (Section 6)

Organized by **Input-Action-Output-Feedback (IPOF) model** [192]:

### Input: Information Access

**1. Guided Input Interaction**
- User-centered optimization (iterative prompt refinement, customizable parameters)
- Interface-supported guidance (visual feedback, multi-panel layouts)
- Multimodal input integration (gestures → parameters, cross-platform synergy)

**2. Context Awareness & Memory Retention**
- Interaction history integration
- Environmental/spatial awareness
- Task-oriented context management
- Personalized context adaptation

**3. Transparency & Explainability**
- Interaction tracking (history documentation)
- Decision visualization (linking actions to results)
- System explanation (rationales for outputs)
- Ideological reflection (prompting critical thinking)

### Action: Exploration

**4. Multimodal Action Space Exploration**
- Text-based, visual, multi-sensory/physical, combined/integrated modalities

**5. Action Coordination**

## Major Challenges (Section 8)

### 1. Creativity & Ownership
- Blurred authorship, IP rights unclear
- Distinguishing human vs AI contributions
- Need for legal frameworks

### 2. Trust & Transparency
- AI's "inhuman" reasoning challenges comprehension
- Ambiguous role within teams
- Balance between autonomy and human oversight

### 3. Data Privacy & Security
- Tension between data needs and privacy protection
- Encryption, access controls, user transparency mechanisms
- Conceptualizing AI as persons obscures legal/safety issues

### 4. Interoperability
- Compatibility across disparate systems
- Maintaining consistent performance across platforms
- Limited controllability in GenAI systems

### 5. Social Impact & Equity
- Job displacement via automation
- Generating inappropriate/harmful content
- Disrupting creative economies

### 6. Ethical & Bias Concerns
- Generating inaccuracies, violating integrity
- Amplifying dominant views
- Confirmation bias, over-reliance
- Multi-source bias (data, models, interaction)

### 7. Long-term Paradigm Shift
- Insufficient consideration of long-term implications
- AI's increasing autonomy altering collaboration models
- Changing how humans interact, self-perceive

## Design Implications (Section 9.3)

### Node Analysis Insights
- **Textual interaction dominates** → Opportunity in underexplored modalities (auditory, embodied)
- **Collaborate stage is central** → Requires robust feedback mechanisms + transparency
- **Co-operative agency is common** → Systems positioning AI as collaborator, not tool

### Pathway Patterns Identified

**Pattern 1: Text-based Co-creation** (Writing, Software)
`Perceive/Collaborate/Build → Textual → Co-operative → Feedback Loops/Transparency → Education & Research`

**Pattern 2: Visual Co-creation** (Art, Design)
`Perceive/Collaborate/Build → Visual → Reactive/Co-operative → Guided Input/Iterative Loop → Artistic Creation`

**Pattern 3: Complex Multimodal** (Systems, Products)
`Perceive/Collaborate/Build/Test → Multimodal → Co-operative/Semi-active → Guided Input/Feedback/Coordination → Software Development`

### Critical Design Considerations
- **Collaborate stage** demands: Iterative feedback loops + Transparency mechanisms
- **High AI initiative** requires: Distinct control granularity + Dynamic agency allocation
- **Sensitive domains** (healthcare, education): Balance utility vs privacy + Rigorous bias mitigation

## Future Research Directions

### Theoretical Gaps (Section 9.5)
1. **Dynamic transitions**: Existing theories don't capture moment-to-moment negotiations
2. **User perception vs. computational reality**: Reconciling discrepancy affects responsibility/trust
3. **Open-ended vs. goal-directed**: Frameworks differ for exploratory vs. structured co-creation

### Socio-technical Shifts (Section 9.4)
- **Theoretical**: From functional tool → autonomous partner; requires new collaboration theories
- **Technical**: From supervisory control → peer-like dynamics; demands novel interaction mechanisms
- **Societal**: Restructuring creative industries; raises IP, compensation, skill evolution questions

### Methodological Needs
- Process theories or computational approaches for fine-grained agency modeling
- Frameworks addressing AI's designed nature vs. user's subjective agency attribution
- Applied examples in context rather than abstract cross-references

## Relation to Collaboration Patterns

The paper validates and operationalizes the **Intent & Interaction framework** from `Behaviours.mdx`:

**Seek–Use–Share temporal progression** maps to:
- **Seek** → Perceive stage
- **Use** → Think, Express, Collaborate, Build stages
- **Share** → Test stage (evaluation, feedback loops)

**Turn-taking & cooperative principles** directly inform:
- Collaborate stage design
- Co-operative agency pattern requirements
- Bidirectional feedback loop mechanisms
