## 4. Technical Architecture / Implementation Details
*How did they build it? Algorithms, data structures, patterns.*

## 5. Application to Pattern Playground
*This is the most important section. Connect the paper's ideas to our specific project.*

### 5.1 Existing Foundations Analysis
*Does the project already have patterns, components, or systems that align with this paper?*
*   **Relevant Files**: (e.g., `src/stories/patterns/Dashboard.tsx`, `specs/intent-schema.ts`)
*   **Assessment**:
    *   [ ] **Aligned**: Our `X` component implements Concept A well.
    *   [ ] **Partial**: Our `Y` component attempts Concept B but misses [specific aspect].
    *   [ ] **Divergent**: Our approach to Z contradicts the paper's findings because...

### 5.2 Gap Analysis
*What is missing entirely?*
*   **Missing Concepts**: The paper describes "Concept C" which we have no equivalent for.
*   **Missing Interactions**: We lack the "Direct Manipulation" capabilities described in Section 3.

### 5.3 Proposed Features / Refactors
*Concrete proposals based on the above analysis.*

#### Proposal A: Enhance [Existing Component]
*   **Goal**: Upgrade `ExistingComponent` to support [Missing Aspect].
*   **Changes**:
    *   Modify `src/...`

#### Proposal B: Implement [New Concept]
*   **Goal**: Fill the gap for [Missing Concept].
*   **Changes**:
    *   Create new component `src/...`

### 5.3 Action Items
*Immediate next steps. Add these to `task.md` or create a new plan.*
- [ ] Create plan `plans/feature-a.md`
- [ ] Prototype component X
