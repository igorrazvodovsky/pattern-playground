# Design principles
- Design for autonomy: Each actor maintains its own organisation. Support coordination without assuming total control.
- Enact domains, not just flows: Ask what new world of action a relation brings into being.
- Ground relations in embodiment: Always trace back to the material substrate.
- Expect drift: Relations evolve; design for learning, renegotiation, and graceful decay.
- Surface breakdowns: Treat them as signals of drift, not just failures.

# Relationship

- Requires: conditions for coupling
- Enables: domain of action enacted
- Risks: breakdowns / maladaptive drift
- Embodiment: what grounds the relation materially
- Trajectory: how the relation changes over time

# Types of relations
- Human ↔︎ Software
- Human ↔︎ LLM
- Human ↔︎ Agent
- Agent ↔︎ Agent
- Agent ↔︎ Software

# Questions
- What does each side need to sustain this relation (requires)?
- What domain of action is enacted here (enables)?
- What breakdowns or maladaptive drifts are likely (risks)?
- What material substrate grounds this relation (embodiment)?
- How is this relation likely to evolve over time (trajectory)?
