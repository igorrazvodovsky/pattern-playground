# DataView Story Implementation Plan

## Overview
Create a comprehensive DataView story that showcases product data with switchable representations and attribute selection.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Create DataView Story (src/stories/compositions/DataView.stories.tsx)
- Import products data from `src/stories/data/products.json`
- Create Card view showing products as cards using existing Card component patterns
- Create Table view showing products in tabular format
- Add dropdown for switching between Card and Table representations
- Add dropdown for selecting which product attributes to display
- Integrate both dropdowns into a toolbar component

### 2. Update DataView Documentation (src/stories/compositions/DataView.mdx)
- Replace the TODO comment with a Canvas element showing the new story
- Link to the DataView.stories.tsx file

### 3. Key Implementation Details

#### Card View
- Display products using card layout with image placeholder, name, description, and selected attributes
- Leverage existing card patterns from `src/stories/compositions/Card/`

#### Table View
- Display products in a structured table with sortable columns
- Use `pp-table` component similar to existing Table stories

#### Representation Dropdown
- Switch between "Cards" and "Table" views
- Use `pp-dropdown` component

#### Attribute Selection Dropdown
Multi-select dropdown to show/hide product attributes like:
- Price
- Category
- Sustainability score
- Availability status
- Carbon footprint
- Lifecycle information

#### Toolbar Integration
- Organize dropdowns in a toolbar similar to the existing Toolbar story pattern
- Follow patterns from `src/stories/compositions/menus-and-actions/Toolbar.stories.tsx`

### 4. Features to Include
- State management for selected view and visible attributes
- Responsive layout that works for both representations
- Proper use of existing components (pp-dropdown, pp-list, pp-table, cards)
- Clean separation of concerns with React hooks for state management

### 5. Data Structure
Product data from `src/stories/data/products.json` contains rich metadata including:
- Basic info: id, name, description, icon
- Pricing: msrp, currency, leaseOptions
- Sustainability: carbonFootprint, recycledContent, certifications
- Lifecycle: designLife, repairability, endOfLifeOptions
- Availability: status, leadTime, regions

### 6. Component Dependencies
- `pp-dropdown` from `src/components/dropdown/`
- `pp-table` component
- Card layout patterns from existing Card stories
- Toolbar patterns from existing Toolbar stories
