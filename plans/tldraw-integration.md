# tldraw Integration Plan for Pattern Playground

## Overview

tldraw offers powerful whiteboard and infinite canvas capabilities that could significantly enhance our design system playground. This document outlines strategic integration opportunities that align with our existing architecture.

## Current tldraw Usage

We already have a sophisticated tldraw implementation in the **Workflow** composition:
- Custom node shapes for mathematical operations
- Connection system with binding utilities
- Custom toolbar with workflow-specific tools
- Port-based node connections
- Execution graph visualisation

## New Integration Opportunities

### 1. Design Pattern Annotation Canvas

**Purpose**: Interactive whiteboard for pattern documentation and exploration

**Features**:
- Import pattern examples and annotate visually
- Draw connections between related patterns
- Collaborative sticky notes for design decisions
- Real-time collaboration on pattern refinements

**Implementation**: New Storybook composition under `compositions/PatternCanvas`

### 2. Component Relationship Mapper

**Purpose**: Visualise component architecture and dependencies

**Features**:
- Component hierarchy diagrams
- Data flow visualisation
- Event propagation mapping
- Atomic design relationships (atoms → molecules → organisms)

**Integration**: Extend existing workflow system with component-specific nodes

### 3. Interactive Documentation Layer

**Purpose**: Enhance component documentation with visual annotations

**Features**:
- Overlay annotations on live component examples
- Interactive tutorials with drawing guides
- Accessibility flow documentation
- Interaction hotspot highlighting

**Implementation**: Custom tldraw component that wraps existing stories

### 4. Enhanced Commenting System

**Purpose**: Extend our pointer-based commenting with visual feedback

**Features**:
- Drawing-based annotations on any content
- Visual connections between related comments
- Sketch alternatives inline
- Contextual markup tools

**Integration**: Extend `src/services/commenting/` with tldraw shape support

### 5. AI-Powered Diagramming

**Purpose**: Leverage existing AI features for diagram generation

**Features**:
- Natural language to diagram conversion
- Component structure generation from sketches
- Auto-layout for workflow diagrams
- AI-suggested visual improvements

**Integration**: Extend `server/` AI endpoints with diagram generation

### 6. Collaborative Design Reviews

**Purpose**: Enable team-based visual feedback

**Features**:
- Direct drawing on component previews
- Live cursors and presence indicators
- Visual bug reports with annotations
- Mood board creation mixing components and sketches

**Implementation**: New review mode in existing compositions

## Technical Implementation

### Quick Setup Options

```bash
# MIT licensed starter kit
npm create tldraw@latest

# Or add to existing project
npm install tldraw
```

### Licensing Considerations

- tldraw SDK 4.0 requires licensing for production use
- MIT licensed starter kits available
- Development use is free
- Consider trial/hobby license for expanded use

### Integration Patterns

**Standalone Pages**:
- New sections in Storybook navigation
- Dedicated canvas compositions
- Independent diagram tools

**Embedded Canvases**:
- tldraw components within existing compositions
- Overlay mode on component examples
- Inline annotation tools

**Hybrid Approach**:
- Custom shapes bridging Web Components and tldraw
- Shared state between tldraw and React components
- Progressive enhancement with canvas features

### Architecture Alignment

**Web Components Integration**:
- Custom tldraw shapes for `pp-` components
- Light DOM compatibility
- Progressive enhancement patterns

**Service Architecture**:
- Framework-agnostic canvas services
- Plugin architecture for different editors
- Pointer-based abstractions for universal commenting

**State Management**:
- Zustand stores for canvas state
- Persistence layer for diagrams
- Real-time synchronisation

## Development Priority

1. **Phase 1**: Pattern annotation canvas (standalone)
2. **Phase 2**: Enhanced commenting with visual markup
3. **Phase 3**: Component relationship mapping
4. **Phase 4**: AI-powered diagram generation
5. **Phase 5**: Interactive documentation overlays

## Next Steps

1. Create proof-of-concept annotation canvas
2. Evaluate licensing requirements for production
3. Design custom shape system for components
4. Integrate with existing comment service
5. Plan AI diagram generation features
