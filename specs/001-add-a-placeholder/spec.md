# Feature Specification: Data View Composition Story

**Feature Branch**: `001-add-a-placeholder`
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "add a placeholder story to @src/stories/compositions/DataView.mdx - use @src/stories/compositions/Card/ and @src/stories/components/Table.mdx to display a list of @src/stories/data/products.json. Include a @src/components/dropdown/ for switching between representations. Include another dropdown for selecting product attributes for display. Organise dropdowns into @src/stories/compositions/menus-and-actions/Toolbar.stories.tsx."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working with the design system, I want to see an interactive Data View composition example so that I can understand how to combine different representation components (cards and tables) with filtering controls to display product data effectively.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the Data View story page is loaded, **When** I view the default state, **Then** I see a product list displayed in the default representation format with toolbar controls visible
2. **Given** I am viewing the Data View story, **When** I interact with the representation switcher dropdown, **Then** I can toggle between card view and table view of the same product data
3. **Given** I am in any view mode, **When** I select different attributes from the attribute selector dropdown, **Then** the displayed data updates to show only the selected product attributes
4. **Given** I switch between representations, **When** the view changes, **Then** the selected attribute filters are preserved across both views
5. **Given** I am viewing the toolbar component, **When** I examine the controls, **Then** I see organised dropdown components that demonstrate proper grouping and layout patterns

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no attributes are selected for display?
- How does the system handle products with missing attribute values?
- What occurs when switching representations with different attribute capabilities?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a working Data View composition story in Storybook
- **FR-002**: System MUST render product data from the existing products.json file in both card and table formats
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to switch between card and table representations using a dropdown control
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to select which product attributes to display using a separate dropdown control
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve attribute selection when switching between view representations
- **FR-006**: System MUST organise control elements into a toolbar composition following established patterns
- **FR-007**: System MUST demonstrate the relationship between Data View composition and its component dependencies (Card, Table, Dropdown, Toolbar)
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a placeholder implementation that serves as a foundation for the full Data View pattern
- **FR-009**: System MUST integrate with existing Storybook infrastructure and documentation standards

### Key Entities
- **Product**: Represents individual items from the product dataset, containing attributes like name, category, specifications, pricing, and sustainability information
- **View Representation**: The display format (card or table) used to present product data
- **Attribute Selection**: The set of product properties chosen for display in the current view
- **Toolbar**: Container for control elements that manage the data view functionality
