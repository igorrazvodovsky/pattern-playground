Behavioral Framework Integration Plan

Phase 1: Foundation Enhancement (Weeks 1-2)

Goal: Establish consistent behavioral vocabulary and application
templates grounded in design principles

1. Create behavioral pattern templates for each behavior mode
(navigating, browsing, exploring, etc.)
2. Develop standard behavioral context sections that can be applied
to any pattern, including:
   - Design principles alignment (combinatorial logic, modularity, hierarchical organisation)
   - Behavioral context mapping
   - Transition pathways documentation
   - Cooperation maxims application
3. Map seek–use–share framework to pattern lifecycle stages
4. Create behavioral transition guidelines for connecting patterns
5. Establish principle-to-behavior mapping guidelines showing how each
design principle manifests in behavioral patterns

Phase 2: Core Navigation Integration (Weeks 3-4)

Priority patterns that directly map to behavioral framework:

1. CommandMenu → Transactional search behavior
2. Breadcrumbs → Motivated movement and re-finding
3. Filtering → Browsing and sense-making behaviors
4. Grouping → Information organization and pattern recognition

Phase 3: State & Feedback Integration (Weeks 5-6)

Essential for behavioral transitions and system cooperation:

1. StateEmpty → Delightful discovery and exploration entry points
2. Notification → Behavioral transition triggers and system feedback
3. StatusFeedback → Consequences of action behavioral phase
4. UnavailableActions → Prerequisites to action phase

Phase 4: Intelligence & Content Integration (Weeks 7-8)

Support AI-enhanced behavioral workflows:

1. Onboarding → Behavioral pattern establishment
2. Suggestion → Encouragement & nudges behavioral phase
3. ProgressiveDisclosure → Managing behavioral complexity
4. Prompt → AI-enhanced behavioral flows

Phase 5: Complete System Integration (Weeks 9-10)

Apply framework to remaining 20+ patterns systematically

Each pattern integration includes:
- Design principles alignment documentation
- Behavioral context mapping
- Transition pathways documentation
- Cooperation maxims application
- Related pattern connections through behavioral lens
- Combinatorial logic examples showing how patterns work together
